Racing Across Different Platforms

Abstract— In high-speed quadcopter racing, finding a single
controller that works well across different platforms remains
challenging. This work presents the first neural network
controller for drone racing that generalizes across physically
distinct quadcopters. We demonstrate that a single network,
trained with domain randomization, can robustly control var-
ious types of quadcopters. The network relies solely on the
current state to directly compute motor commands. The effec-
tiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-
world tests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-
inch race quadcopters). We further compare the performance of
this generalized controller with controllers specifically trained
for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using their identified model
parameters with varying levels of domain randomization (0%,
10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows
slightly slower speeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it
excels in adaptability across different platforms. Our results
show that no randomization fails sim-to-real transfer while
increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces
speed. Despite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential
of domain randomization for generalizing controllers, paving
the way for universal AI controllers that can adapt to any
platform.

I. INTRODUCTION
The drone market is experiencing rapid growth [1], yet
most applications still rely on human pilots. Given that
battery life limits flight times, enhancing the speed and
autonomy of drones offers significant advantages [2]. As a
result, research into autonomous drone racing is a growing
field that contributes to advancing technology and enhancing
drone capabilities.
One of the significant challenges in drone racing is the de-
velopment of controllers that generalize well across different
quadcopter platforms. While human pilots can easily adapt to
various drones with minimal adjustments, current racing AI
systems often overfit to their specific platforms, restricting
their generalization capabilities. This limitation hampers the
transfer of current drone racing technology to other real-
world applications [2].
Recent advancements in quadcopter control have predom-
inantly focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques
[3]–[7]. These methods have demonstrated impressive results
in drone racing, with neural controllers surpassing human
champions [6]. However, these achievements rely on precise

modeling of the drone platforms and struggle to generalize
across different drones.
Domain randomization (DR) has emerged as a prominent
method for transferring RL policies across different envi-
ronments. This technique involves training policies in simu-
lated environments with varied parameters to improve their
robustness when deployed in real-world scenarios [8]. For
instance, DR has facilitated single-shot sim-to-real transfer
for robot manipulation [9], visual navigation using synthetic
data [10], and object detection [11]. Additionally, in end-
to-end quadcopter control, DR, combined with real-time
adaptation, has been critical for bridging the reality gap
[12]–[14]. However, although DR enhances robustness, it
comes with trade-offs, including longer training times and
diminished performance optimality [8], [15].
Current research on generalized quadcopter control has
only focused on low-level tasks in near-hover or recovery-to-
hover conditions, with little exploration into racing scenarios
that demand both guidance and control at significantly higher
speeds. Recent studies have explored various approaches:
one developed a network for stabilizing low-level control
(position control and trajectory tracking) that generalizes
to various quadcopters using domain randomization [16].
Another method [17] introduced a single-shot real-time
technique for controlling an unknown quadcopter through
iterative determination of the actuator effectiveness param-
eters of an INDI controller, expanding on the work of
[18]. Additionally, recent work trained a neural network to
estimate a latent representation of quadcopter parameters,
conditioning another neural network controller for near-hover
flight, enabling online adaptation to varying hardware and

disturbances during real-world deployment [19].
In this work, we extend these results to drone racing by
using domain randomization to develop a neural network
controller for high-speed racing that generalizes across dif-
ferent quadcopters. Our controller maps state information
directly to motor commands, enabling end-to-end guidance
and control. Our key contributions include:
1) Introducing, to the best of our knowledge, the first
neural network controller capable of operating across
different drones for high-speed racing
2) Investigation into the effects of varying degrees of
domain randomization on sim-to-real transferability
and flight speed performance.
This paper is organized as follows: Sec. II presents the
drone model and control formulation; Sec. III describes the
experimental setup; Sec. IV analyzes the performance of the
general control network and examines the effects of varying
degrees of domain randomization; and Sec. V provides the
conclusion and outlines directions for future work.
II. METHODOLOGY
A. Quadcopter model
To train our neural policies we simulate our quadcopter
dynamics with a parametric model similar to the one outlined
in [14]. The quadcopter’s state and control are given by:
x = [p, v, λ, Ω, ω]T
u = [u1, u2, u3, u4]T
Here p is the position of the drone, v is the velocity, λ
are the Euler angles, Ωare the body rates and ω are the
propeller speed in rad/s. u ∈[0, 1]4 represents the normalized
commands sent to the motor controllers. The equations of
motion are expressed as follows:
˙p = v
˙v = ge3 + R(λ)F
(1)
˙λ = Q(λ)Ω
˙Ω= M
˙ωi = (ωci −ω)/τ
(2)
Where R is the rotation matrix and Q transforms body rates
to Euler angle derivatives. The steady state motor response is
modeled as: ωci = (ωmax −ωmin)
p

The specific force F and the moment M 1 are modeled as:

The parameters k□, ωmin, ωmax are estimated from manual

linear regression. We normalize the parameters based on the

maximum angular velocity ωmax. The normalized parameters
are:
ˆkω, ˆkpi, ˆkqi = (kω, kpi, kqi) × ω2
max
ˆkxi, ˆkyi, ˆkri = (kxi, kyi, kri) × ωmax
This scaling accounts for variations in ωmax and ensures
consistency across the model. The estimated values can be
found in Tab. I. These parameters highlight the distinct
control characteristics of each platform. For instance, the
3-inch platform has approximately half the thrust-to-weight
ratio (proportional to ˆkω), motors that spin 50% faster, and
less than half the pitch effectiveness (ˆkpi) compared to the
5-inch platform.
B. RL problem definition
The racing setup consists of seven square gates, each
measuring 1.5x1.5 meters, arranged in a figure-eight track,
as shown in Fig. 1. The drone starts 1 meter in front of a
randomly selected gate, in a similar fashion as [3]. The other
initial state variables are defined as follows: v ∈[−0.5, 0.5]3,
ϕ, θ ∈[−π
9 , π
9 ], ψ ∈[−π, π], Ω∈[−0.1, 0.1]3, and
ω ∈[ωmin, ωmax]. Similar to [5] the reward function to be
optimised consists of a progress reward, a rate penalty and
a collision penalty:
rk =
(
−10,
if collided
||pk−1 −pgk|| −||pk −pgk|| −c||Ω||
otherwise
Here, pgk denotes the position of the center of the current
target gate, while pk, pk−1 are the drone’s current and
previous positions. The rate penalty coefficient is set to
c = 0.001. A collision is registered when the drone either
makes contact with the ground or when it flies outside of a
10x10x7m bounding box. When a collision is registered, the
episode ends. Additionally when a gate is missed (i.e. drone
passes gate plane outside of 1.5x1.5m area, the episode also
ends.
This reward function, together with the quadcopter model
from the previous section, is used to create a gym environ-
ment for training with the PPO algorithm [20], utilizing the
Python library Stable-Baselines3 [21]. Our implementation
simulates 100 drones in parallel, uses a discount factor of
γ = 0.999 and a maximum episode length of 1200 time steps

(12 seconds). The training process concludes after a total of
100 million time steps. The code for our implementation is
openly available on GitHub2.
C. Randomization
1) General policy: The randomization outlined in Tab.
II trains the general policy to control the 3-inch and 5-
inch quadcopters. Uniform distributions were designed to
encompass parameters from both sizes.
2) Fine tuned policy: We train five policies for the 3- and
5 inch quadcopter by applying randomization to the values
from Tab. I, introducing variations of 0%, 10%, 20%, and
30%. Specifically, each parameter is multiplied by U(1 −
p, 1 + p), where p represents the randomization percentage.
The thrust linearization constant kl is an exception, as it is
capped to ensure it remains below 1.
D. Policy
The selected neural policy is a three-layer fully connected
network with ReLU activation functions, with 64 neurons
per layer (see Sec. IV-A for motivation). The policy takes
in 20 observations, including the quadcopter’s state and
information about current and future gates, similar to prior
work [14]:
xobs = [pgi, vgi, λgi, Ω, ω, pgi
gi+1, ψgi
gi+1]T
(3)
Here, gi denotes the reference frame of the i−th gate, and
pgi+1 and ψgi+1 represent the position and orientation of
the next gate. The network outputs four motor commands
(u). Because domain randomization is applied to the model
parameters, these parameters become part of the state in the
Markov decision process (MDP). As a result, the full state
is not completely observable with the current observation
formulation [15]. Some approaches try to address this by
incorporating state or action history into the observation [6],
[22], while others use parameter inputs [19]. In Sec. IV-A,
we explore these methods and justify our choice of Eq. 3.
III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We test our policies on two quadcopters. Common be-
tween them is the compute hardware and experimental in-
frastructure: we use an STM32H743 microcontroller running
INDIflight3, a fork of Betaflight. An onboard EKF fuses

data from a TDK InvenSense ICM-42688-P IMU, and po-
sition/attitude observations from an external optical motion
capture system (Optitrack). The state is then used by the
Neural Network, onboard, at an update rate of 1000Hz.
Fig. 2.
This picture shows the drone used for testing. Instead of bolts, four
cornerpieces of Moongel are placed on top of the base frame, on which a
3D printed casing with the flight controller is placed. A second layer of
Moongel is then placed on the casing, which is then slightly compressed
downward by means of two zip-ties.
During initial testing, at high speeds, propeller vibrations
caused the accelerometer to saturate, exceeding the ±16g
limit of the accelerometer. We aimed to address this problem
by adding a vibration damping pad as shown in Fig. 2. Sor-
bothane, adhesive tape and Moongel Damper Pads [23] were
compared, but the latter proved to provide the most effective
high-frequency resonance control whilst still transmitting
the lower frequency true movements of the drone. This
result aligns with findings from previous research on damper
pad performance, where Moongel was indeed shown to be
optimal at eliminating noise [24]. The 3D-printed casing,
while not mandatory, aids in distributing the forces more
evenly across the FC, whereas the zip-ties connected to the
base frame provide preloaded compression for maintaining
stability and improving damping performance.
IV. RESULTS
A. Selecting Architecture
We evaluated several architectures using the randomized
simulator and selected the 3-layer 64-neuron architecture as
the best based on the highest obtained mean episode rewards
from three independent runs, each consisting of 100 million
time steps. Network size comparisons are illustrated in Fig. 3.
Next, we modified the selected architecture to address partial
observability by adding various inputs. The modifications
included:
• Adding the last 1, 2, or 3 actions to the observation
• Adding the last 1, 2, or 3 actions with stepsize 10 (steps
of 0.1s in the past)
• Adding state history (last 1, 2, or 3 states, with or
without stepsize 10)
• Adding model parameters (ground truth) or with 10%
and 20% noise
Each variation followed the same training setup and was
evaluated over 1000 rollouts. See Fig. 4 for results. None
of the modified inputs showed a clear improvement, leading
us to exclude them from further use. This unexpected result
indicates a need for further investigation, which may involve
longer training periods, hyperparameter tuning, or alternative

we will focus on the network without additional inputs.
B. Simulation
We trained the selected architecture on 9 different envi-
ronments: the general randomization described in Sec. II-
C.1 and the fine-tuned models described in Sec. II-C.2,
which include 3-inch and 5-inch drones with 0%, 10%, 20%,
and 30% randomization levels. Training followed the same
procedure as above. Performance was evaluated with 1000
rollouts on both the 3-inch and 5-inch drone environments
(with identical initial conditions sampled from the ranges
described in II-B). See Tab. III. As shown, the general model
performs effectively across both quadcopter simulations,
navigating gates with a crash rate of 5.4% in the 3-inch
environment and 1.2% in the 5-inch environment. However,
it underperforms slightly compared to the fine-tuned models
for each specific drone. Interestingly, the fine-tuned models
do not transfer between drone types, resulting in 100% crash

rates due to non-overlapping parameter ranges, even with
30% randomization. Among the fine-tuned models, lower
randomization levels correlate with higher mean episode
rewards, though at the cost of a slight increase in crash rates.
C. Real flights
We now test the networks that performed well in simu-
lation on their respective platforms. Specifically, fine-tuned
models are evaluated on their designated platforms, while
the general model is tested on both the 3-inch and 5-
inch quadcopters. All flights begin from a hover state, 1
meter in front of gate 1, and are repeated three times (12
seconds each, matching the maximum episode length used
in the RL framework). The first flight uses a fully charged
battery, with subsequent flights performed as the battery
depletes, leaving it near empty by the third run. Flight logs
are subsampled at 100Hz to match the simulator’s time
step, enabling direct comparison through the episode reward
metric. Additionally, each flight is replicated in the simulator
using the same initial conditions. The trajectories of both
real and simulated flights are shown in Fig. 5. It can be
seen here that the general network successfully navigates the
race track on both drones, albeit slightly slower. Performance
metrics for all flights are presented in Tab. IV-B and IV-B,
showing that as randomization decreases from 30% to 10%,
performance improves, with the highest rewards at 10%. At
0% randomization, the drone no longer passes through the
gates. Fig. 6 provides a box plot of the episode rewards,
clearly illustrating how the reality gap widens as domain
randomization decreases.
D. Time Optimality
The rewards in the framework are designed to learn
time-optimal flight. It is useful to not only compare the
achieved episode rewards to the optimal during training

Domain randomization enables the same network to fly different
quadcopters; however with performance penalties. No domain randomiza-
tion results in failed sim2real transfer: our DR approach stands as an
alternative to higher modeling effort, at a small performance cost.

The optimal control solution through the race track for the 5inch
quadcopter
but also compare actual lap times to time-optimal flight
as a means of validation and context. The optimal figure
8 path (see Fig.7) was formulated as a boundary value
problem and solved with [25] for the 5-inch model, yielding
a theoretical lap-time of 1.07s, compared to 1.6s for our
fastest RL policies in simulation, and 1.9s in real-life.
Even though the time-optimal program did not include
drag terms, we attribute the bulk of the difference to the
sub-optimal path taken by the RL policies; relatively far
away from the edges of the gates. However, the optimal
control approach returns 1.53s when forcing passing the
gate-centers. This suggests that our reward function does
not perfectly align with optimizing lap times. As shown
in Tab. IV-B, the 10% fine-tuned network achieves the
highest real-life performance in terms of episode reward,
yet it flies through fewer gates than the 20% variant.
We therefore conclude that, to achieve more time-optimal
performance on a tight track, the reward function should
include terms that allow better tuning of the risk-reward
balance, encouraging the agent to fly closer to the gate edges.
V. CONCLUSION
In this work, we introduced a neural network controller for
high-speed drone racing capable of operating across multiple
quadcopter platforms. We demonstrated its effectiveness with
real flights on both 3-inch and 5-inch quadcopters at speeds
up to 10 m/s. Our benchmarking involved comparing this
generalized controller against neural policies specifically
trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch quadcopters with vary-
ing levels of domain randomization. While our generalized
model showed slightly reduced performance compared to
the fine-tuned controllers, it exhibited superior transferability
across platforms. Our experiments revealed that increased
domain randomization initially enhances robustness and
helps bridge the reality gap. However, excessive randomiza-
tion ultimately compromises flight speed. We explored incor-
porating online adaptation into our network, as discussed in
[17] and [19], but did not achieve the desired improvements.
Potential factors include training duration, hyperparameter
tuning, or the choice of parameter representations. Neverthe-
less, the significant success of our generalized approach, even
without additional inputs, highlights its promise and paves
the way for future research. Addressing the identified chal-
lenges could lead to substantial performance enhancements,
making this an exciting avenue for further exploration.
