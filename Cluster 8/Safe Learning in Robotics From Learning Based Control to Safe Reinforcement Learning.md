Abstract
The last half-decade has seen a steep rise in the number of contri-
butions on safe learning methods for real-world robotic deployments
from both the control and reinforcement learning communities. This
article provides a concise but holistic review of the recent advances
made in using machine learning to achieve safe decision making under
uncertainties, with a focus on unifying the language and frameworks
used in control theory and reinforcement learning research.
Our re-
view includes: learning-based control approaches that safely improve
performance by learning the uncertain dynamics, reinforcement learn-
ing approaches that encourage safety or robustness, and methods that
can formally certify the safety of a learned control policy.
As data-
and learning-based robot control methods continue to gain traction,
researchers must understand when and how to best leverage them in
real-world scenarios where safety is imperative, such as when operating
in close proximity to humans. We highlight some of the open challenges
that will drive the ﬁeld of robot learning in the coming years, and em-
phasize the need for realistic physics-based benchmarks to facilitate fair
comparisons between control and reinforcement learning approaches.

1. INTRODUCTION
Robotics researchers strive to design systems that can operate autonomously in increas-
ingly complex scenarios, often in close proximity to humans. Examples include self-driving
vehicles (1), aerial delivery (2), and the use of mobile manipulators for service tasks (3).
However, the dynamics of these complex applications are often uncertain or only partially
known—for example, the mass distribution of a carried payload might not be given a pri-
ori. Uncertainties arise from various sources. For example, the robot dynamics may not be
perfectly modeled, sensor measurements may be noisy, and/or the operating environment
may not be well-characterized or may include other agents whose dynamics and plans are
not known.
In these real-world applications, robots must make decisions despite having only partial
knowledge of the world. In recent years, the research community has multiplied its eﬀorts
to leverage data-based approaches to address this problem. This was motivated in part by
the success of machine learning in other areas such as computer vision and natural language
processing.
A crucial, domain-speciﬁc challenge of learning for robot control is the need to implement
and formally guarantee safety of the robot’s behavior, not only for the optimized policy (or
controller, which is essential for the certiﬁcation of systems that interact with humans) but
also during learning, to avoid costly hardware failures and improve convergence. Ultimately,
these safety guarantees can only be derived from the assumptions and structure captured
by the problem formalization.
Both control theory and machine learning—reinforcement learning (RL) in particular—
have proposed approaches to tackle this problem. Control theory has traditionally taken
a model-driven approach (see Figure 1): it leverages a given dynamics model and pro-
vides guarantees with respect to known operating conditions. RL has traditionally taken
a data-driven approach, which makes it highly adaptable to new contexts at the expense
of providing formal guarantees. Combining model-driven and data-driven approaches, and
leveraging the advantages of each, is a promising direction for safe learning in robotics. The
methods we review encourage robustness (by accounting for the worst-case scenarios and
taking conservative actions), enable adaptation (by learning from online observations and
adapting to unknown situations), and build and leverage prediction models (based on a
combination of domain knowledge, real-world data, and high-ﬁdelity simulators).
While control is still the bedrock of all current robot applications, the body of safe RL

Figure 1: A comparison of model-driven, data-driven, and combined approaches.
literature has ballooned from tens to over a thousand publications in just a few years since
its most recent review (4). Physics-based simulation (5), which we leverage in our open-
source benchmark implementation1, has played an important role in the recent progress of
RL, however, the transfer to real systems remains a research area in itself (6).
Previous review works focused on speciﬁc techniques—for example, learning-based
model predictive control (MPC) (7), iterative learning control (ILC) (8, 9), model-based
RL (10), data-eﬃcient policy search (11), imitation learning (12), or the use of RL in
robotics (13, 14) and in optimal control (15)—without emphasizing the safety aspect.
Recent surveys on safe learning control focus on either control-theoretic (16) or RL ap-
proaches (17), and do not provide a unifying perspective.
In this article, we provide a bird’s eye view of the most recent work in learning-based
control and reinforcement learning that implement safety and provide safety guarantees for
robot control. We focus on safe learning control approaches where the data generated by
the robot system is used to learn or modify the feedback controller (or policy). We hope
to help shrink the gap between the control and RL communities by creating a common
vocabulary and introducing benchmarks for algorithm evaluation that can be leveraged by
both (18, 19). Our target audience are researchers, with either a control or RL background,
who are interested in a concise but holistic perspective on the problem of safe learning
control. While we do not cover perception, estimation, planning, or multi-agent systems,
we do connect our discussion to these additional challenges and opportunities.
2. PRELIMINARIES AND BACKGROUND OF SAFE LEARNING CONTROL
In this review, we are interested in the problem of safe decision making under uncertainties
using machine learning (i.e., safe learning control). Intuitively, in safe learning control, our
goal is to allow a robot to fulﬁl a task while respecting a set of safety constraints despite
the uncertainties present in the problem. In this section, we deﬁne the safe learning control
problem (Sec. 2.1) and provide an overview of how the problem of decision making under
uncertainties has traditionally been tackled by the control (Sec. 2.2) and RL communities
(Sec. 2.3). We highlight the main limitations of these approaches and articulate how novel
data-based, safety-focused methods can address these gaps (Sec. 2.4).

Figure 2: The safe learning control problem is deﬁned by the cost function J, the system
model f, and the constraints c, which may all be initially unknown. Data is used to update
the control policy (see Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2) or the safety ﬁlter (see Sec. 3.3).
2.1. Problem Statement
We formulate the safe learning control problem as an optimization problem to capture the
eﬀorts of both the control and RL communities. The optimization problem has three main
components (see Figure 2): (i) a system model that describes the dynamic behavior of the
robot, (ii) a cost function that deﬁnes the control objective or task goal, and (iii) a set of
constraints that specify the safety requirements. The goal is to ﬁnd a controller or policy
that computes commands (also called inputs) that enable the system to fulﬁl the task while
respecting given safety constraints. In general, any of the components could be initially
unknown or only partially known. Below, we ﬁrst introduce each of the three components
and conclude by stating the overall safe learning control problem.
M1. Transition
Probability Function:
The dynamics model
in Equation 1 can be
equivalently
represented as a
state transition
probability func-
tion Tk(xk+1 | xk, uk),
commonly seen in
RL approaches (20).
2.1.1. System Model. We consider a robot whose dynamics can be represented by the
following discrete-time model:
xk+1 = fk(xk, uk, wk),
1.
where k ∈Z≥0 is the discrete-time index, xk ∈X is the state with X denoting the state
space, uk ∈U is the input with U denoting the input space, fk is the dynamics model of the
robot, wk ∈W is the process noise distributed according to a distribution W (see also M1).
Throughout this review, we assume direct access to (possibly noisy) measurements of the
robot state xk and neglect the problem of state estimation. Equation 1 represents many
common robot platforms (e.g., quadrotors, manipulators, and ground vehicles). More com-
plex models (e.g., partial diﬀerential equations) may be necessary for other robot designs.
2.1.2. Cost Function. The robot’s task is deﬁned by a cost function. We consider a ﬁnite-
horizon optimal control problem with time horizon N. Given an initial state x0, the cost
is computed based on the sequence of states x0:N = {x0, x1, ..., xN} and the sequence of
inputs u0:N−1 = {u0, u1, ..., uN−1}:
J(x0:N, u0:N−1) = lN(xN) +
N−1
X
k=0
lk(xk, uk),

## Page 5

where lk : X × U 7→R is the stage cost incurred at each time step k, and lN : X 7→R is
the terminal cost incurred at the end of the N-step horizon (see also M2). The stage and
M2. Discounted
Rewards: The stage
cost can be related
to the discounted
rewards in RL:
lk = −γkrk(xk, uk),
where
rk : X × U 7→R is
the reward function,
and γ ∈[0, 1] is the
discount factor (20).
We formulate a cost
minimization
problem for safe
learning control,
while RL typically
solves a reward
maximization
problem.
terminal cost functions map the state and input sequences, which may be random variables,
to a real number, and may, for example, include the expected value or variance operators.
2.1.3. Safety Constraints. Safety constraints ensure, or encourage, the safe operation of the
robot and include: (i) state constraints Xc ⊆X, which deﬁne the set of safe operating states
(e.g., the lane in self-driving), (ii) input constraints Uc ⊆U (e.g., actuation limits), and
(iii) stability guarantees (e.g., the robot’s motion converging to a desired path, see M3).
M3. Stability: There
are diﬀerent notions
of stability in the
control
literature (21).
Stability generally
implies boundedness
of the system state.
One common notion
of stability is
Lyapunov stability,
which requires the
system to either stay
close to (stable) or
converge to
(asymptotically
stable) a desired
state.
To encode the safety constraints, we deﬁne nc constraint functions: ck(xk, uk, wk) ∈
Rnc with each constraint cj
k being a real-valued, time-varying function.
Starting with
the strongest guarantee, we introduce three levels of safety: hard, probabilistic, and soft
constraints (illustrated in Figure 3). In practice, safety levels are often mixed. For example,
input constraints are typically hard constraints but state constraints may be soft constraints.
Safety Level III: Constraint Satisfaction Guaranteed. The system satisﬁes hard con-
straints:
cj
k(xk, uk, wk) ≤0 ,
3.
for all times k ∈{0, ..., N} and constraint indexes j ∈{1, ..., nc}.
Safety Level II: Constraint Satisfaction with Probability p. The system satisﬁes prob-
abilistic constraints:
Pr

cj
k (xk, uk, wk) ≤0

≥pj ,
4.
where Pr(·) denotes the probability and pj ∈(0, 1) deﬁnes the likelihood of the j-th con-
straint being satisﬁed, with j ∈{1, ..., nc} and for all times k ∈{0, ..., N}. The chance
constraint in Equation 4 is identical to the hard constraint in Equation 3 for pj = 1.
Safety Level I: Constraint Satisfaction Encouraged. The system encourages con-
straint satisfaction. This can be achieved in diﬀerent ways. One way is to add a penalty
term to the objective function that discourages the violation of constraints with a high cost.
A non-negative ϵj is added to the right-hand side of the inequality Equation 3, for all times
k ∈{0, ..., N} and j ∈{1, ..., nc},
cj
k(xk, uk, wk) ≤ϵj ,
5.
and an appropriate penalty term lϵ(ϵ) ≥0 with lϵ(ϵ) = 0
⇐⇒
ϵ = 0 is added to the
objective function. The vector ϵ includes all elements ϵj and is an additional variable of the
optimization problem. Alternatively, although cj
k(xk, uk, wk) is a step-wise quantity, some
approaches only aim to provide guarantees on its expected value E[·] on a trajectory level:
Jcj = E
"N−1
X
k=0
cj
k (xk, uk, wk)
#
≤dj ,
6.
where Jcj represents the expected total constraint cost, and dj deﬁnes the correspond-
ing constraint threshold.
The constraint function can optionally be discounted as
γkcj
k (xk, uk, wk), similar to the stage cost (see M2).
2.1.4. Formulation of the Safe Learning Control Problem. The functions introduced above,
i.e., the system model f, the constraints c, and the cost function J, represent the true
functions of the robot control problem. In practice, f, c, and J may be unknown or partially

known. Without loss of generality, we assume that each of the true functions f, c, and J
can be decomposed into a nominal component ¯(·), reﬂecting our prior knowledge, and an
unknown component ˆ(·), to be learned from data. For instance, the dynamics model f can
be decomposed as
fk(xk, uk, wk) = ¯fk(xk, uk) + ˆfk(xk, uk, wk),
7.
where ¯f is the prior dynamics model and ˆf are the uncertain dynamics.
Safe learning control (SLC) leverages our prior knowledge P = {¯f, ¯c, ¯J} and the data
collected from the system D = {x(i), u(i), c(i), l(i)}i=D
i=0 to ﬁnd a policy (or controller) πk(xk)
that achieves the given task while respecting all safety constraints,
SLC : (P, D) 7→πk,
8.
where (·)(i) denotes a sample of a quantity (·)k and D is the data set size. More speciﬁcally,
we aim to ﬁnd a policy πk that best approximates the true optimal policy π⋆
k, which is the
solution to the following optimization problem:

are introduced to account for the soft safety constraint case (Safety Level I, Equation 5) and
are set to zero, for example, if only hard and probabilistic safety constraints are considered
(Safety Levels II and III).
2.2. A Control Theory Perspective
Safe decision making under uncertainty has a long history in the ﬁeld of control theory.
Typical assumptions are that a model of the system is available and it is either parameterized
by an unknown parameter or it has bounded unknown dynamics and noise.
While the
control approaches are commonly formulated using continuous-time dynamic models, they
are usually implemented in discrete time with sampled inputs and measurements (see M4).
M4. Continuous
Time:
Many
classical control
approaches rely on a
continuous-time
formulation.
Consider the
uncertain
time-varying,
continuous-time
model
˙x = ft(x, u, w),
where x, u and w
are functions of
time t. We can
recover our discrete
state through
sampling
xk = x(k∆t), where
∆t is the sampling
time. Similarly, the
discrete control
input is
uk = u(k∆t) and
often kept
constant (22) over
the time interval
[k∆t, (k + 1)∆t).
Adaptive control considers systems with parametric uncertainties (see M5) and adapts
the controller parameters online to optimize performance. Adaptive control requires knowl-
edge of the parametric form of the uncertainty (23) and typically considers a dynamics
www.dynsyslab.org

## Page 7

model that is aﬃne in u and the uncertain parameters θ ∈Θ:
xk+1 = ¯fx(xk) + ¯fu(xk)uk + ¯fθ(xk)θ ,
10.
where ¯fx, ¯fu, and ¯fθ are known functions often derived from ﬁrst principles and Θ is a pos-
sibly bounded parameter set. The control input is uk = π(xk, ˆθk), which is parameterized
by ˆθk. The parameter ˆθk is adapted by using either a Lyapunov function to guarantee that
the closed-loop system is stable (see M6) or Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC)
to make the system behave as a predeﬁned stable reference model (23). Adaptive control
is typically limited to parametric uncertainties and relies on a speciﬁc model structure.
Moreover, adaptive control approaches tend to “overﬁt” to the latest observations and con-
vergence to the true parameters is generally not guaranteed (23, 24). These limitations
motivate the learning-based adaptive control approaches in Sec. 3.1.1.
M5. Parametric
Uncertainty: A
parametric model
depends on a ﬁnite
number of
parameters that may
have a physical
interpretation or
reﬂect our prior
knowledge about the
system structure in
other ways.
Parametric
uncertainty is the
uncertainty in the
model parameters.
Robust control is a control design technique that guarantees stability for pre-speciﬁed
bounded disturbances, which can include unknown dynamics and noise.
In contrast to
adaptive control, which adapts to the parameters currently present, robust control ﬁnds
a suitable controller for all possible disturbances and keeps the controller unchanged after
the initial design. Robust control is largely limited to linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems
with linear nominal model ¯f(xk, uk) = ¯Axk + ¯Buk and unknown dynamics ˆfk(xk, uk, wk) =
ˆAxk + ˆBuk + wk ∈D, with D being known and bounded, and ¯A, ¯B, ˆA, ˆB being static
matrices of appropriate size. That is,
xk+1 = ( ¯A + ˆA)xk + ( ¯B + ˆB)uk + wk .
11.
Robust control design techniques, such as robust H∞- and H2-control design (25), yield
controllers that are robustly stable for all ˆfk ∈D.
Robust control can be extended to
nonlinear systems whose dynamics can be decomposed into a linear nominal model ¯f and a
nonlinear function ˆf with known bound ˆf ∈D (26).
Robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) extends classical adaptive and robust
control by additionally guaranteeing state and input constraints, xk ∈Xc and uk ∈Uc, for
all possible bounded disturbances ˆf ∈D. At every time step k, MPC solves a constrained
optimization problem over a control input sequence uk:k+H−1 for a ﬁnite horizon H, and
applies the ﬁrst optimal control input to the system and then re-solves the optimization
problem in the next time step based on the current state (27). A common approach in

Function:
Lyapunov
functions are used to
analyze the stability
of a dynamical
system (21).
Consider a
closed-loop system
under some
policy π(x):
xk+1 = fπ(xk) =
f(xk, π(xk)) with
fπ(xk) being
Lipschitz
continuous. A
Lipschitz continuous
positive deﬁnite
function
L : X →R≥0 with
L(0) = 0 and
L(x) > 0, ∀x ̸= 0, is
a Lyapunov
function, if L maps
states under
closed-loop state
feedback to strictly
smaller values (i.e.,
∆L(x) = L(fπ(x)) −
L(x) < 0). This
implies that the
state converges to
the equilibrium at
the origin. There
exists an analogous
formulation for
continuous-time
systems based on the
derivatives of L (21).
robust MPC (RMPC) is tube-based MPC (28), which uses a nominal prediction model
¯f(xk, uk) in the MPC optimization and tightens the constraints to account for unmodeled
dynamics.
A stabilizing controller keeps the true state inside a bounded set of states
around the nominal state, called tube, for all possible disturbances.
Since the nominal
states satisfy the tightened constraints and the true states stay inside the tube around the
nominal states, constraint satisfaction for the true states is guaranteed. Tube-based MPC
typically considers a linear nominal model ¯f(¯xk, ¯uk) = ¯A¯xk + ¯B¯uk with nominal state ¯xk
and input ¯uk. In its simplest implementation, prior knowledge of set D is combined with
a known stabilizing linear controller, uk,stab = K(xk −¯xk) with gain K, to determine the
bounded tube Ωtube from the matrices ¯A, ¯B, K, and the set D. The stabilizing controller
uk,stab keeps all potential errors within the tube, xk −¯xk ∈Ωtube, for all k.
For the
nominal model, tube-based MPC solves the following constrained optimization problem at
every time step k to obtain the optimal sequence ¯u∗

where zi is the open-loop nominal state at time step k+i and the state and input constraints
are tightened using the bounded tube Ωtube (see M7).Combined with the stabilizing control
input uk,stab, the control input uk = uk,stab + ¯u∗
0 is applied to the system at every time
step. Stability and satisfaction of the tightened constraints is guaranteed by selecting the
terminal cost lH in Equation 12a, such that after the prediction horizon H the nominal state
zH is within a terminal constraint set Xterm (see Equation 12d) at which point a known
linear controller can be safely applied (27).

Tightening:
The
constraint sets Xc
and Uc are tightened
by an error tube
Ωtube using the
Pontryagin
diﬀerence,
Xc ⊖Ωtube = {x ∈
X : x + ω ∈Xc, ∀ω ∈
Ωtube} and
Uc ⊖KΩtube, where
K maps all elements
in Ωtube to the
control input
space U with
KΩtube.
Both robust control and robust MPC are conservative, as they guarantee stability and—
in the case of MPC—state and input constraints for the worst-case scenario. This usually
yields poor performance, as described in (7). For example, a conservative uncertainty set
D generates a large tube Ωtube resulting in tight hard constraints that are prioritized over
cost optimization. Learning-based robust control and RMPC improve performance by using
data to (i) learn a less conservative state- and input-dependent uncertainty set D and/or
(ii) learn the unknown dynamics ˆf and, as a result, reduce the remaining model uncertainty,
see Sec. 3.1.2 and Sec. 3.1.3 respectively.
2.3. A Reinforcement Learning Perspective
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the standard machine learning framework to address the
problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty. Unlike traditional control, RL
generally does not rely on an a priori dynamics model ¯f and can be directly applied to
uncertain dynamics f. However, the lack of explicit assumptions and constraints in many
of the works limit their applicability to safe control. RL algorithms attempt to ﬁnd π∗
while gathering data and knowledge of f from interaction with the system—taking ran-
dom actions, initially, and improving afterwards. A long-standing challenge of RL, which
hampers safety during the learning stages, is the exploration-exploitation dilemma—that
is, whether to (i) act greedily with the available data or to (ii) explore, which means taking
sub-optimal—possibly unsafe—actions u to learn a more accurate ˆf.
RL typically assumes that the underlying control problem is a Markov decision pro-
cess (MDP). An MDP comprises a state space X, an input (action) space U, stochastic
dynamics (also called transition model, see M1), and a per-step reward function (see M2).
When all the components of an MDP are known (in particular, f and J in Sec. 2.1), then
it solves the problem in Equations 9a, 9b, 9c without the constraints. Dynamic program-
ming (DP) algorithms such as value and policy iteration can be used to ﬁnd an optimal
policy π∗. Many RL approaches, however, make no assumptions on any part of f being
known a priori.
M8. Value and
Action-Value
Functions:
The
value function of
state xk under
policy πk, V πk(xk),
is the expected
return J of applying
πk from xk.
Similarly, the
action-value function
of action uk in state
xk under πk,
Qπk(xk, uk), is the
expected return J
when taking the
action uk at xk, and
then following πk.
We can distinguish model-based RL approaches, which learn an explicit model ˆf of the
system dynamics f and use it to optimize a policy, from model-free RL algorithms. The
latter algorithms (29) can be broadly categorized as: (i) value function-based methods,
learning a value function (see M8); (ii) policy-search and policy-gradient methods, directly
trying to ﬁnd an optimal policy π∗; and (iii) actor-critic methods, learning both a value
function (critic) and the policy (actor). We also note that the convergence of these methods
has been shown for simple scenarios but is still a challenge for more complex scenarios or
when function approximators are used (30).
There are multiple practical hurdles to the deployment of RL algorithms in real-world
robotics problems (6), for example, (i) the continuous, possibly high-dimensional X and U in
robotics (often assumed to be ﬁnite, discrete sets in RL), (ii) the stability and convergence
of the learning algorithm (31) (necessary, albeit not suﬃcient, to produce a stable policy,
see M3), (iii) learning robust policies from limited samples, (iv) the interpretability of the
learned policy—especially in deep RL when leveraging neural networks (NNs) (see M9) for
function approximation (29)—and, importantly, (v) providing provable safety guarantees.
M9. Neural
Network:
A neural
network (NN) is a
computational
model with
interconnected layers
of neurons
(parameterized by
weights) that can be
used to approximate
highly nonlinear
functions.
The exploration-exploitation dilemma can be mitigated using Bayesian inference. This

is achieved by computing posterior distributions over the states X, possible dynamics f, or
total cost J from past observed data (32). These posteriors provide explicit knowledge of
the problem’s uncertainty and can be used to guide exploration. In practice, however, full
posterior inference is almost always prohibitively expensive and concrete implementations
must rely on approximations.
To achieve constraint satisfaction (over states or sequences of states) and robustness to
diﬀerent, possibly noisy dynamics f, constrained MDPs and robust MDPs are extensions
of traditional MDPs that more closely resemble the problem statement in Sec. 2.1.
Constrained MDPs (CMDPs) (33) extend simple MDPs with constraints and opti-
mize the problem in Equation 9 when Equation 9e takes the discounted form of Safety Level
I ’s Equation 6. We refer to the discounted constraint cost Jcj under policy π as Jπ
cj. Tradi-
tional approaches to solve CMDPs, such as Linear Programming and Lagrangian methods,
often assume discrete state-action spaces and cannot properly scale to complex tasks such
as robot control. Deep RL promises to mitigate this, yet, applying it to the constrained
problem still suﬀers from the computational complexity of the oﬀ-policy evaluation (M10)
of trajectory-level constraints Jcj (34). In Sec. 3.2.3, we present some recent advances in
CMDP-based work that feature: (i) integration of deep learning techniques in CMDPs for
more complex control tasks; (ii) provable constraint satisfaction throughout the exploration
or learning process; and (iii) constraint transformation for the eﬃcient evaluation of Jcj
from data collected oﬀ-policy.
M10. Oﬀ-policy,
On-policy, and
Oﬄine RL:
Oﬀ-policy RL
improves the value

with data collected
operating under
diﬀerent policies.
On-policy methods
only use data
generated by the
current policy.
Oﬄine RL uses data
previously collected
by an unknown
policy.
Robust MDPs (35), inspired by robust control (see Sec. 2.2), extend MDPs such that
the dynamics can include parametric uncertainties or disturbances, and the cost of the
worst-case scenario is optimized. This is captured by the min-max optimization problem:

Equation 9b, Equation 9c, Equation 9d,
13b.
where D is a given uncertainty set of ˆf. To keep solutions tractable, practical implemen-
tations typically restrict D to certain classes of models. This can limit the applicability of
robust MDPs beyond toy problems. Recent work (36, 37, 38) applied deep RL to robust de-
cision making, targeting key theoretical and practical hurdles such as (i) how to eﬀectively
model uncertainty with deep neural networks, and (ii) how to eﬃciently solve the min-max
optimization (e.g., via sampling or two-player, game-theoretic formulations). These ideas,
including adversarial RL and domain randomization, are presented in Sec. 3.2.4.
2.4. Bridging Control Theory and RL for Safe Learning Control
When designing a learning-based controller, we typically have two sources of information:
(i) our prior knowledge, and (ii) data generated by the robot system. Control approaches
rely on prior knowledge and on assumptions such as parametric dynamics models to pro-
vide safety guarantees. RL approaches typically make use of expressive learning models
to extract patterns from data that facilitate learning complex tasks, but these can impede
the provision of any formal guarantees. In recent literature, we see an eﬀort from both the
control and RL communities to develop safe learning control algorithms, with the goal of
systematically leveraging expressive models for closed-loop control (see Figure 4). Ques-
tions that arise from these eﬀorts include: how can control-theoretic tools be applied to
expressive machine learning models? Or, how can expressive models be incorporated into
control frameworks?

A
Gaussian process
(GP) is a set of

which any ﬁnite

Practically, a GP is
a probabilistic model
specifying a

functions.
Expressive learning models can be categorized as deterministic (e.g., standard deep
neural networks (DNNs)) or probabilistic (e.g., Gaussian processes (GPs), see M11, and
Bayesian linear regression (BLR)). Deep learning techniques such as feed-forward NNs,
convolutional NNs, and long short-term memory networks have the advantage of being able

to abstract large volumes of data, enabling real-time execution in a control loop. On the
other hand, their probabilistic counterparts, such as GPs and BLRs, provide model output
uncertainty estimates that can be naturally blended into traditional adaptive and robust
control frameworks. We note that there are approaches aiming to combine the advantages of
the two types of learning (e.g., Bayesian NNs), and quantifying uncertainty in deep learning
is still an active research direction.
In this review, we focus on approaches that address the problem of safe learning control
at two stages: (i) online adaptation or learning, where online data is used to adjust the
parameters of the controller, the robot dynamics model, the cost function, or the constraint
functions during closed-loop operation; and (ii) oﬄine learning, where data collected from
each trial is recorded and used to update a model in a batch manner in between trials
of closed-loop operation.
In safe learning control, data is generally used to address the
issue of uncertainties in the problem formulation and reduce the conservatism in the system
design, while the safety aspect boils down to “knowing what is not known” and cautiously
accounting for the incomplete knowledge via algorithm design.
3. SAFE LEARNING CONTROL APPROACHES
The ability to guarantee safe robot control is inevitably dependent on the amount of prior
knowledge available and the type of uncertainties present in the problem of interest. In this
section, we discuss approaches for safe learning control in robotics based on the following
three categories (see Figure 2 and Figure 4):
• Learning uncertain dynamics to safely improve performance: The ﬁrst set
of works we review relies on an a priori model of the robot dynamics. The robot’s
performance is improved by learning the uncertain dynamics from data. Safety is
typically guaranteed based on standard control-theoretic frameworks, achieving Safety

Level II or III.
• Encouraging safety and robustness in RL: The second set of works encompasses
approaches that usually do not have knowledge of an a priori robot model or the
safety constraints. Rather than providing hard safety guarantees, these approaches
encourage safe robot operation (Safety Level I), for example, by penalizing dangerous
actions.
• Certifying learning-based control under dynamics uncertainty: The last set
of works aims to provide safety certiﬁcates for learning-based controllers that do
not inherently consider safety constraints.
These approaches modify the learning
controller output by either constraining the control policy, leveraging a known safe
backup controller, or modifying the controller output directly to achieve stability
and/or constraint satisfaction. They typically achieve Safety Level II or III.
Figure 4 categorizes the approaches reviewed in this section based on their safety level and
reliance on data. A more detailed summary of the approaches can be found in Table 1 of
Appendix A.
3.1. Learning Uncertain Dynamics to Safely Improve Performance
In this section, we consider approaches that improve the robot’s performance by learning
the uncertain dynamics and provide safety guarantees (Safety Level II or III) via control
frameworks such as adaptive control, robust control, and robust MPC (outlined in Sec. 2.2).
These approaches make assumptions about the unknown parts of the problem (e.g., Lips-
chitz continuity) and often rely on a known model structure (e.g., control-aﬃne or linear
system with bounded uncertainty) to prove stability and/or constraint satisfaction (see
Figure 4).
3.1.1. Integrating Machine Learning and Adaptive Control. There are three main ideas to
incorporating online machine learning into traditional adaptive control (see Sec. 2.2), each
with its own distinct beneﬁts. These include: (i) using black-box machine learning models
to accommodate nonparametric unknown dynamics, (ii) using probabilistic learning and
explicitly accounting for the learned model uncertainties, in order to achieve cautious adap-
tation, and (iii) augmenting adaptive control with deep learning approaches for experience
memorization in order to minimize the need for re-adaptation.
Learning Nonparametric Unknown Dynamics with Machine Learning Models. One
goal of integrating adaptive control and machine learning is to improve the performance of
a robot subject to nonparametric dynamics uncertainties. As opposed to Equation 10, we
consider a system with nominal dynamics ¯f(xk, uk) = ¯Axk + ¯Buk and unknown dynam-
ics ˆf(xk, uk) = ¯B ψk(xk), where ψk(xk) is an unknown nonlinear function without an obvi-
ous parametric structure. Learning-based MRAC approaches (39, 40) make the uncertain
system behave as the linear nominal model ¯f by using a combination of L1 adaptation (41)
and online learning to approximate ψk(xk) by ˆψk(xk) = ˆψL1,k + ˆψlearn,k(xk), where ˆψL1,k is
the input computed by the L1 adaptive controller and ˆψlearn,k is the input computed by the
learning module, which can be an NN (39) or a GP (40). The estimated ˆψk(xk) is then used
in the controller πk(xk) to account for the unknown nonlinear dynamics ψk(xk), improving
a linear nominal control policy designed based on ¯f. In these approaches, fast adaptation
and stability guarantees are provided by the L1 adaptation framework (Safety Level III),
while the learning module provides additional ﬂexibility to capture the unknown dynamics.
As shown in (39), the addition of learning improves the performance of the standard L1
adaptive controller and allows fast adaptation to be achieved at a lower sampling rate.
Cautious Adaptation with Probabilistic Model Learning. Another stream of adap-
Safe Learning in Robotics
11

## Page 12

tive control approaches leverage probabilistic models to achieve cautious adaptation by
weighting the contribution of the learned model based on the model output uncertainty.
We consider a system with nominal dynamics ¯f(xk, uk) = ¯fx(xk) + ¯fu(xk)uk and unknown
dynamics of the same form ˆf(xk, uk) = ˆfx(xk) +ˆfu(xk)uk, where ˆfx(xk) and ˆfu(xk) are un-
known nonparametric nonlinear functions. In a model inversion-based MRAC framework,
an approximate feedback linearization is achieved via the nominal model to facilitate the
design of MRAC, and a GP-based adaptation approach is used to compensate for feedback
linearization errors due to the unknown dynamics (42). To account for the uncertainty in
the GP model learning, the controller relies on the GP model only if the conﬁdence in the
latter is high: πk(xk) = πnom(xk) −γ(xk, uk) πlearn,k(xk), where πnom(xk) is the control
policy designed based the nominal model, πlearn,k(xk) is the adaptive component designed
based on the GP model, and γ(xk, uk) ∈[0, 1] is a scaling factor with 0 indicating low
conﬁdence in the GP. The stability of the overall system (Safety Level III) is guaranteed
via a stochastic stability analysis, and the eﬃcacy of the approach has been demonstrated
in quadrotor experiments (43, 42).
Memorizing Experience with Deep Architectures. Apart from compensating for non-
linear and nonparametric dynamics uncertainties, deep learning approaches have also been
applied to adaptive control for “memorizing” generalizable feature functions as the system
adapts. In particular, an asynchronous DNN adaptation approach is proposed in (44, 45).
Similar to (39, 40), we consider a linear nominal model ¯f(xk, uk) = ¯Axk+ ¯Buk and unknown
nonlinear dynamics ˆf(xk, uk) = ¯B ψk(xk) with ψk(xk) being an unknown nonlinear func-
tion. In the proposed approach, the last layer of the DNN is updated at a higher frequency
for fast adaptation, while the inner layers are updated at a lower frequency to “memorize”
pertinent features for the particular operation regimes. To provide safety guarantees, the
authors derive an upper bound on the sampling complexity of the DNN to achieve a pre-
scribed level of modelling error and leverage this result to show that Lyapunov stability of
the adapted system can be guaranteed (Safety Level III) by ensuring the modelling error
of the DNN is lower than a given bound. In contrast to other MRAC approaches, which do
not usually retain a memory of the past experience, the inner layers of the asynchronous
DNN in (44, 45) store relevant features that facilitate adaptation when similar scenarios
arise in the future.
3.1.2. Learning-based Robust Control. Learning-based robust control improves the perfor-
mance of classical robust control in Sec. 2.2 by using data to improve the linear dynamics
model and reduce the uncertainty in Equation 11.
Using a Gaussian Process Dynamics Model for Linear Robust Control. The conser-
vative performance of robust control in Sec. 2.2 is improved by updating the linear dynamics
model and uncertainty in Equation 11 with a Gaussian Process (46) (GP). The unknown
nonlinear dynamics ˆf(xk, uk) are learnt as a GP, which is then linearized about an operat-
ing point. By linearizing the GP (as opposed to directly ﬁtting a linear model) data close
to the operating point are prioritized. The uncertain linear dynamics in Equation 11 are
assumed to be modelled as ˆA = A0 + ˜A∆, ˆB = B0 + ˜B∆, where A0 and B0 are obtained
from the linearized GP mean, ˜A and ˜B are obtained from the linearized GP variance (often
two standard deviations), and ∆represents a matrix with elements taking any value in the
range of [−1, +1]. Further performance improvement is achieved by modelling ˜A and ˜B
as state dependent (47). Additionally, (48) was able to achieve better performance than
(46) by leveraging the GP’s distribution, while maintaining the same level of safety. The
main advantage of these approaches is that they can robustly guarantee Safety Level II
stability while improving performance. This is achieved by shrinking the GP uncertainty as
more data is added, which improves the linear model A0 and B0 and reduces the uncertain
component ˜A and ˜B. This has been shown on a quadrotor (46). However, these approaches
www.dynsyslab.org

## Page 13

are limited to stabilization tasks and do not account for state and input constraints.
Exploiting Feedback Linearization for Robust Learning-Based Tracking. Trajectory
tracking convergence, as opposed to the simpler stabilization task performed in (46), is
guaranteed by exploiting the special structure of exactly feedback linearizable systems (49).
This structure assumes that the nonlinear system dynamics in Equation 1 can be described
by a linear nominal model, where ¯A and ¯B have an integrator chain structure. It also
assumes that the unknown dynamics are ˆf(xk, uk) = ¯Bψ(xk, uk), where ψ(xk, uk) is an
unknown invertible function.
A probabilistic upper bound is obtained for ψ(xk, uk) by
learning this function as a GP. A robust linear controller is designed for the uncertain system
based on this learnt probabilistic bound. Further performance improvement is achieved by
also updating the feedback linearization (50) through improving the estimate of the inverse
ψ−1(·). These approaches have been applied to trajectory tracking, with Safety Level II,
on Lagrangian mobile manipulators in (49) and quadrotor models in (50). However, they
hinge on this special structure and cannot account for state and input constraints.
3.1.3. Reducing Conservatism in Robust MPC with Learning and Adaptation. The conser-
vative nature of robust MPC (Sec. 2.2) is improved—while still satisfying input and state
constraints—through (i) robust adaptive MPC, which adapts to parametric uncertainty,
and (ii) learning-based robust MPC, which learns the unknown dynamics ˆf or, in one case,
cost ˆJ.
Robust Adaptive MPC. Robust adaptive MPC assumes parametric uncertainties, and
(i) uses data to reduce the set of possible parameters over time or (ii) uses an inner-loop
adaptive controller and an outer-loop robust MPC. This leads to improved performance
compared to standard robust MPC (see Sec. 2.2), while satisfying hard constraints (Safety
Level III).
The ﬁrst set of approaches considers stabilization tasks, where the full system dynamics,
Equation 10, are assumed to be linear and stable (51) or linear and unstable (52) with
uncertain parameter θ ∈Θ0:
xk+1 = ( ¯A + ˆA(θ))xk + ( ¯B + ˆB(θ))uk + wk .
14.
The process noise and the parameters are assumed to be bounded by known sets W and
the initially conservative Θ0, respectively. Given W and Θ0, we can derive a conservative
upper bound on the uncertain dynamics ˆf(xk, uk, wk, θ) = ˆA(θ)xk + ˆB(θ)uk + wk ∈D0,
where D0 is a compact set determined from W and Θ0. To guarantee constraint satisfaction,
tube-based MPC (see Sec. 2.2) is applied, where the initial tube Ωtube,0 is based on D0.
To reduce the conservatism of the approach, an adaptive control method is introduced to
improve the estimate of the parameter set Θk and reduce the size of the tube Ωtube,k at
each time step k. This idea has been extended to stochastic process noise for probabilistic
constraint satisfaction (Safety Level II) (53), time-varying parameters (54), and linearly
parameterized uncertain nonlinear systems (55, 56). Further performance improvement is
achieved by combining robust adaptive MPC with iterative learning (57), which updates
the terminal constraint set Xterm in Equation 12d and the terminal cost lH in Equation 12a
after every full iteration using the closed-loop state trajectory and cost (58). In the second
approach, an underlying MRAC (see Sec. 2.2) is used to make the closed-loop system
dynamics resemble a linear reference model with bounded disturbance set D (59). This
linear model and its bounds are then used in an outer-loop robust MPC to achieve fast
stabilization in the presence of model errors.
Learning-Based Robust MPC. Learning-based robust MPC uses data to (i) improve the
unknown dynamics estimate, (ii) reduce the uncertainty set, or (iii) update the cost to
avoid states with high uncertainty. Unlike robust adaptive control, learning-based robust
MPC considers nonparameterized systems.

Under the assumption of a linear nominal model ¯f(x, u) = ¯Ax + ¯Bu and bounded
unknown dynamics ˆf(xk, uk) ∈D, the unknown dynamics can be safely learned from data,
e.g., using a NN (60). Robust constraint satisfaction, Equation 12c, is guaranteed by using
tube-based MPC for the linear nominal model and performance improvement is achieved by
optimizing over the control inputs for the combined nominal and learned dynamics. If the
bounded unknown dynamics are assumed to be state-dependent ˆf(xk) ∈D(xk), instead of
using a constant tube Ωtube, the state constraints in Equation 12c can be tightened based
on the state-dependent uncertainty set D(x) (61). In a numerical stabilization task, a GP
is used to model ˆf(xk) and its covariance determines D(x). This yields less conservative,
probabilistic state constraints (Safety Level II).
Learning-based robust MPC can be extended to nonlinear nominal models. Typically, a
GP is used to learn the unknown dynamics ˆf(x, u): the mean updates the dynamics model
in Equation 12b and the state- and input-dependent uncertainty set D(x, u) is derived from
the GP’s covariance and contains the true uncertainty with high probability. Similarly, the
state- and input-dependent tube in Equation 12c is determined from the uncertainty set
D(x, u). The main challenge, compared to using a linear nominal model, is the uncertainty
propagation over the prediction horizon in the MPC because Gaussian uncertainty (obtained
from the GP) is no longer Gaussian when propagated through the nominal nonlinear dy-
namics. Approximation schemes are required, such as using a sigma-point transform (62),
linearization (63), exact moment matching (64), or ellipsoidal uncertainty set propaga-
tion (65). Additionally, further approximations (e.g., ﬁxing the GP’s covariances over the
prediction horizon (63)) are usually required to achieve real-time implementation. These
approximations can lead to violations of the probabilistic constraints (Safety Level II) in
Equation 9e. An alternative approach to address the challenges of GPs uses a NN regres-
sion model that predicts the quantile bounds of the tail of a state trajectory distribution
for a tube-based MPC (66). However, this approach is hindered by typically nonexhaustive
training data sets, which can lead to the underestimation of the tube size.
M12. Lipschitz
Continuity:
A
function h : A 7→B
is said to be
Lipschitz continuous
on A if (∃ρ > 0)
such that for any
a1, a2 ∈A the
condition
||h(a1) −h(a2)|| ≤
ρ||a1 −a2|| holds,
where A and B are
the domain and
codomain of h, and
|| · || denotes any
lp-norm of a vector.
The constant ρ is
called a Lipschitz
constant of h.
For repetitive tasks, another approach is to adjust the cost function based on data
instead of the system model.
The predicted cost error is learned from data using the
diﬀerence between the predicted cost at each time step and the actual closed-loop cost at
execution. By adding this additional term to the cost function, the MPC penalizes states
that had previously resulted in higher closed-loop cost than expected Equation 12a (67),
resulting in reliable performance despite model errors.
M13. Region of
Attraction:
Let x∗
be an equilibrium of
a closed-loop system
under some
policy π(x):
xk+1 = fπ(xk) =
f(xk, π(xk)) with
fπ(xk) being
Lipschitz
continuous. The
region of attraction
(ROA) of x∗is the
set of states from
which the system
will converge to x∗.
3.1.4. Safe Model-Based RL with A Priori Dynamics. Safe model-based RL augments
model-based RL (see Sec. 2.3) with safety guarantees (see Figure 4). Stability can be
probabilistically guaranteed (Safety Level II) under the assumption that the known nomi-
nal model ¯f(xk, uk) and the unknown part ˆf(xk, uk) are Lipschitz continuous with known
Lipschitz constants (see M12) (68). Given a Lyapunov function (see M6), an initial safe
policy π0, and a GP to learn the unknown dynamics ˆf, a control policy πk is chosen so
that it maximizes a conservative estimate of the region of attraction (ROA) (see M13). The
most uncertain states (based on the GP’s covariance) inside the ROA, are explored. This
reduces the uncertainty over time and allows the ROA to be extended. The practical im-
plementation resorts to discrete states for tractability and retains the stability guarantees
while being sub-optimal in (exploration) performance.
3.2. Encouraging Safety and Robustness in Reinforcement Learning
The approaches in this section are safety-augmented variations of the traditional MDP and
RL frameworks. In general, these methods do not assume knowledge of an a priori nominal
model ¯f and some also learn the reward or step cost l (69), or the safety constraints c (70).
Rather than providing strict safety guarantees, these approaches encourage constraint satis-

faction during and after learning, or robustness of the learned control policy π to uncertain
dynamics (Safety Level I, see Figure 4). In plain MDP formulations, (i) states and inputs
(or actions) are assumed to have known, often discrete and ﬁnite, domains but they are not
further constrained while searching for an optimal policy π∗and (ii) only loose assumptions
are made on the dynamics f, for example, the system being Markovian (20) (see M14).
M14. Markov
Property:
The
probability for a
system to be in state
xk at time k only
depends on the state
at time k −1, xk−1
and, in MDPs,
uk−1.
A previous taxonomy of safe RL (4)—covering research published up until 2015—
distinguished methods that either modify the exploration process to include external knowl-
edge or modify the optimality criterion J with a safety factor. However, as pointed out
in (71), the number and breadth of publications in RL, including safe RL, has since greatly
increased. Because the approaches recently proposed in this area are numerous and diverse,
we provide a high-level review of some of the most signiﬁcant trends with a focus on their
applicability to robotics. These include: (i) the safe exploration of MDPs; (ii) risk-aware
and cautious RL adaptation; (iii) RL based on constrained MDPs; and (iv) robust RL.
M15. Ergodicity:
An MDP is ergodic
if, by following a
given policy, any
state is reachable
from any other state.
Ergodic properties of
dynamical systems
are key to establish
conditions for their
controllability (72).
3.2.1. Safe Exploration and Optimization. An RL algorithm’s need to explore poses a chal-
lenge to its safety as it must select inputs with unpredictable consequences in order to learn
about them.
Safe Exploration. The problem of safely exploring an MDP is tackled in (73) through
the notion of ergodicity (see M15). Policy updates that preserve the ergodicity of the MDP
enable the system to return to an arbitrary state from any state.
Thus, the core idea
is to restrict the space of eligible policies to those that make the MDP ergodic (with at
least a given probability). Exactly solving this problem, however, is NP-hard. A simpliﬁed
problem is solved in (73), using a heuristic exploration algorithm (74), which leads to sub-
optimal but safe exploration that only considers a subset of the ergodic policies. In practice,
(73) is demonstrated in two simulated scenarios with discrete, ﬁnite X and U.
Rather
than designing for a recoverable exploration through ergodicity, safe exploration strategies
that provide constraint satisfaction are developed in (75, 70). A safety layer is used to
convert an optimal but potentially unsafe action ulearn,k produced by an NN policy, to the
closest safe action usafe,k with respect to some safety state constraint. Both (75) and (70)
involve solving a constrained least squares problem, usafe,k = arg minuk∥uk −ulearn,k∥2
2,
which is akin to the safety ﬁlter approaches further discussed in Sec. 3.3.2. Concretely,
(75) assumes full knowledge of the (linear) constraint functions and solves usafe,k using a
diﬀerentiable Quadratic Programming (QP) solver. In contrast, (70) assumes constraints
are unknown a priori but can be evaluated. Thus, the approach learns the parameters
of linear approximations to these constraints and then uses them in the solver. Notably,
(75, 70) consider single time-step state constraints.
In Sec. 3.2.3, we will also discuss
methods that deal with more general trajectory-level constraints (Equation 6).
Safe Optimization. Several works address the problem of safely optimizing an unknown
function (typically the cost function), often exploiting GP models (76). Safety refers to
sampling inputs that do not violate a given safety threshold (Equation 3, Equation 4). These
approaches fall under the category of Bayesian optimization (77) and include SafeOpt (78);
SafeOpt-MC (79), an extension towards multiple constraints; StageOpt (80), a the more
eﬃcient two-stage implementation; and GoSafe (81), to explore beyond the initial safe
region. In particular, SafeOpt infers two subsets of the safe set from the GP model: (i) one
with candidate inputs to extend the safe set, and (ii) one with candidate input to optimize
the unknown function—from which it greedily picks the most uncertain. The ideas pioneered
by SafeOpt were applied to MDPs in SafeMDP (69) resulting in safe exploration of MDPs
with an unknown cost function l(x, u), which (69) models as a GP. In SafeMDP, the single-
step reward represents the safety feature that should not violate a given threshold. Another
extension of (78), SafeExpOpt-MDP (82), treats the safety feature cj and the MDP’s cost l as
two separate, unknown functions, allowing for the constraint of the ﬁrst and the optimization

of the latter. A recent survey of these techniques was provided in (76), highlighting the
distinction between safe learning in regression—i.e., minimizing the selection and evaluation
of non-safe training inputs—and safe exploration in MDPs and stochastic dynamical systems
like Equation 9b—i.e., selecting action inputs that also preserve ergodicity).
M16. Conservative
Q-learning (CQL):
A recent oﬄine RL
approach (83) to
mitigate the
overestimation
problem in value
functions.
Q-learning is known
to overestimate
action-state values
because of its
maximization
operator, and oﬄine
RL can lead to
overestimated values
of the actions that
are more likely
under the policy
used to collect the
data. CQL tackles
this by using a novel
update rule with a
simple regularizer to
learn value lower
bounds instead.
M17. Model
Ensembles:
Collections of
learned models can
be used to mitigate
noise or better
capture the
stochasticity of a
system. Probabilistic
Ensembles with
Trajectory Sampling
(PETS) (84) is a
model-based RL
method that uses
model ensembles
and probabilistic
networks to capture
uncertainties in the
system dynamics.
Learning a Safety Critic. A safety critic is a learnable action-value function Qπ
safe that can
be used to detect if a proposed action can lead to unsafe conditions. The works (85, 86, 87)
make use of such a critic and then resort to various fallback schemes to determine a safer
alternative input. These works diﬀer from those in Sec. 3.3.2 in that the ﬁltering criterion
depends on a model-free, learned value function, which can only grant the satisfaction of
Safety Level I.
M18. Conditional
Value at Risk
(CVaR): CVaRα is
a risk measure that
is equal to the
average of the worst
α-percentile of the
total cost J (88).
In (85), safety Q-functions for reinforcement learning (SQRL) are used to (i) learn a
safety critic from only abstract, sparse safety labels (e.g., a binary indicator), and (ii) trans-
fer knowledge of safe action inputs to new but similar tasks. SQRL trains Qπ
safe to predict
the future probability of failure in a trajectory, and uses it to ﬁlter out unsafe actions from
the policy π. The knowledge transfer is achieved by pre-training Qπ
safe and π in simulations,
and then ﬁne-tuning π on the new task (with similar dynamics f and safety constraints),
still in simulation, while reusing Qπ
safe to discriminate unsafe inputs. However, the success
of the ﬁnal safe policy still depends on the task- and environment-speciﬁc hyperparame-
ters (85) (which must be found via parameter search, in simulation, prior to the actual
experiment). Building on (85), Recovery RL (86) additionally learns a recovery policy πrec
to produce fallback actions for Qπ
safe as an alternative to ﬁltering out unsafe inputs and
resorting to potentially sub-optimal ones in π. In (87), the authors extend Conservative Q-
Learning (CQL, see M16) and propose Conservative Safety Critic (CSC). Similarly to (85),
CSC assumes sparse safety labels and uses Qπ
safe for action ﬁltering, but it trains Qπ
safe to
upper bound the probability of failure and ensures provably safe policy improvement at
each iteration.
3.2.2. Risk-Averse RL and Uncertainty-Aware RL. Safety in RL can also be encouraged
by deriving and using risk (or uncertainty) estimates during learning. These estimates are
typically computed for the system dynamics or the overall cost function, and leveraged to
produce more conservative (and safer) policies.
Risk can be deﬁned as the probability of collision for a robot performing a navigation
task (89, 90).
A collision model, captured by a neural network ensemble trained with
Monte Carlo dropout, predicts the probability distribution of a collision, given the current
state and a sequence of future actions. The collision-averse behavior is then achieved by
incorporating the collision model in a MPC planner.
In (91), the authors build upon PETS (84) (see M17) to propose cautious adaptation for
safe RL (CARL). CARL is composed of two training steps: (i) a pre-training phase that is
not risk-aware, where a PETS agent is trained on multiple diﬀerent system dynamics, and
(ii) an adaptation phase, where the agent is ﬁne-tuned on the target system by taking risk-
averse actions. CARL also proposed two notions of risk, one to avoid low-reward trajectories
and another to avoid catastrophes (e.g., irrecoverable states or constraint violations). In
SAVED (92), a PETS (84) agent is used to predict the probability of a robot’s collision
and to evaluate a chance constraint for safe exploration. Similarly to the methods in the
last paragraph of Sec. 3.2.1, SAVED also learns a value function from sparse costs, which
it uses as a terminal cost estimate.
To learn risk-averse policies using only oﬄine data, the approach in (93) optimizes for
a risk measure of the cost such as Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) (see M18). Instead of
using model ensembles as in (89, 90, 91), the work in (93) uses distributional RL (see M19)
to explicitly model the distribution of the total cost of the task (control of a simulated 1D
car), and oﬄine learning to improve scalability.

3.2.3. Constrained MDPs and RL. The CMDP framework is frequently used in safe RL, as
it introduces constraints that can be used to express arbitrary safety notions in the form of
Equation 6. RL for CMDPs, however, faces two important challenges (see Sec. 2.3): (i) how
to incorporate and enforce constraints in the RL algorithm; and (ii) how to eﬃciently solve
the constrained RL problem—especially when using deep learning models, which are the de
facto standard in non-safe RL. Works in this section that address these questions include
(i) Lagrangian methods for RL, (ii) generalized Lyapunov functions for constraints, and
(iii) Backward Value Functions. Nonetheless, much of the work in this section remains con-
ﬁned to rather naive simulated tasks, motivating further investigation into the applicability
of constrained RL in real-world control.
M19. Distributional
RL: Distributional
RL (94) focuses on
the modeling and
learning of the
distribution of the
cost J, rather than
its expected value.
The greater
descriptive power
can enable richer
predictions and
risk-aware
behaviours.
M20. Lagrangian
Methods:
To solve
a constrained
optimization
problem
minx f(x) s.t. g(x) ≤
0, Lagrangian
methods deﬁne a
Lagrangian function
L(x, λ) =
f(x) + λg(x) on
primal variable x,
dual variable λ, and
solve the equivalent
unconstrained
problem
maxλ≥0 minx L(x, λ).
In practice,
numerical
approaches, such as
gradient methods,
are often used to
perform the
primal-dual
updates (88).
Lagrangian Methods in RL Optimization. In (88, 95), the CMDP optimization problem
(see Sec. 2.3) is ﬁrst transformed into an unconstrained optimization one (see M20) over
the primal variable π and dual variable λ using the Lagrangian L(π, λ), and RL is used as
a subroutine in the primal-dual updates for Equation 15b:
L(π, λ) = Jπ +
X

15a.
(π∗, λ∗) = arg max
λ≥0 min
π L(π, λ)
s.t.
Equation 9b, 9c, 9d .
15b.
In particular, (88) deﬁnes a constraint on the CVaR of cost Jπ, and uses policy gradient
or actor-critic methods to update the policy in Equation 15b. In subsequent work (95),
the authors improve upon (88) by incorporating oﬀ-policy updates of the dual variable
(with the on-policy primal-dual updates).
This is empirically shown to achieve better
sample eﬃciency and faster convergence. In (34), the authors extend a standard trust-region
(see M21) RL algorithm (96) to CMDPs using a novel bound that relates the expected cost
of two policies to their state-averaged divergence (see M21). The key idea is performing
primal-dual updates with surrogates/approximations of the cost Jπ and constraint cost Jπ
cj
derived from the bound. The beneﬁts are two-fold: (i) the surrogates can be estimated
with only state-action data, bypassing the challenge of trajectory evaluation from oﬀ-policy
data; and (ii) the updates guarantee monotonic policy improvement and near constraint
satisfaction at each iteration (Safety Level I). However, unlike (88, 95), each update involves
solving the dual variables from scratch, which can be computationally expensive.
A Lyapunov Approach to Safe RL. Lyapunov functions (see M6) are used extensively in
control to analyze system stability and they are a powerful tool to translate a system’s global
properties into local conditions. In (97, 98), Lyapunov functions are used to transform the
trajectory-level constraints Jπ
cj in Equation 6 into step-wise, state-based constraints. This
allows a more eﬃcient computation of Jπ
cj and mitigates the cost of oﬀ-policy evaluation.
These approaches, however, require the system to start from a baseline policy π0 that
already satisﬁes the constraints. In (97), four diﬀerent algorithms are proposed to solve
CMDPs by combining traditional RL methods and the Lyapunov constraints, but they
are only applicable to discrete input spaces (with continuous state spaces). In subsequent
work (98), the authors of (97) extend the approach to continuous input spaces and standard
policy gradient methods, addressing its computational tractability.
Learning Backward Value Functions. The work in (99) proposes Backward Value Func-
tions (BVF) as a way to overcome the excessive computational cost of the approaches in
the previous paragraphs (34, 98). Similarly to a (forward) value function V π that estimates
the total future cost from each state, a BVF V b,π estimates the accumulated cost so far (up
to the current state). We can decompose a trajectory-level constraint at any time step k as
sum of V π
cj (xk) and V b,π
cj (xk) for the constraint cost Jπ
cj. This decomposition also alleviates
the problem of oﬀ-policy evaluation as these value functions can be learned concurrently
and eﬃciently via Temporal Diﬀerence (TD) methods (see M22). In practice, V π
cj , V b,π
cj ,
Safe Learning in Robotics

V π are jointly learned (99) and used for policy improvement at each time step, allowing to
implement Safety Level I. The approach is intended for discrete action spaces but can be
adapted to continuous ones as in (70).
M21. Divergence:
Divergence
quantiﬁes the
similarity between
probability
distributions. It may
not satisfy the
symmetry and the
triangle inequality of
a distance metric. In
RL, commonly used
ones include
Kullback-Leibler
divergence (KL),
total variation
distance (TV), and
the Wasserstein
distance, which is
also a valid distance
metric. Divergence
measures can be
used to constrain
policy updates in
trust-region RL
algorithms (96).
3.2.4. Robust MDPs and RL. Works in this section aim to implement robustness in RL,
speciﬁcally, learning policies that can operate under disturbances and generalize across sim-
ilar tasks or robotic systems. This is typically done by framing the learning problem as a
robust MDP (Equation 13). In (100), Robust RL (RRL) implements an Actor-Disturber-
Critic architecture. The authors observes that the learned policy and value function coincide
with those derived analytically from H∞control theory for linear systems (see Sec. 2.2).
However, more recent robust RL literature often abstains from assumptions on dynamics
or disturbances, and applies model-free RL (101) to seek empirically robust performance at
the expense of theoretical guarantees. In the following paragraphs, we introduce two lines
of work: (i) robust adversarial RL, which explicitly models the min-max problem in Equa-
tion 13 in a game theoretic fashion; and (ii) domain randomization, which approximates
the same problem in Equation 13 by learning on a set of randomized perturbed dynamics.
M22. Temporal
Diﬀerence Learning:
Temporal Diﬀerence
(TD) learning (20)
is an important class
of model-free RL
methods that
updates the value
function by
bootstrapping from
the current estimate
using the Bellman
equation to
formulate
sampling-based,
iterative updates.
For example, given a
control step data
tuple (xk, lk, xk+1)
we can perform a
learning step as
V π(xk) ←V π(xk)+
α(lk + γV π(xk+1) −
V π(xk)) where α, γ
are the step size and
discount factor.
Robustness Through Adversarial Training.
Combining RL with adversarial learn-
ing (102) results in robust adversarial RL (RARL) (36), where the robust optimization
problem (Equation 13) is set up as a two-player, discounted zero-sum Markov game in
which an agent (protagonist) learns policy π to control the system and another agent (ad-
versary) learns a separate policy to destabilize the system. The two agents learn in an
alternated fashion (each is updated while ﬁxing the other), attempting to progressively
improve both the robustness of the protagonist’s policy and the strength of its adversary.
The work of (37) extends (36) with risk-aware agents (see Sec. 3.2.2), with the protagonist
being risk-averse and the adversary being risk-seeking. This method learns an ensemble of
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) (103) and deﬁnes the risk of an action based on the variance of its
value predictions. In another extension of (36), a population of adversaries (rather than a
single one) is trained (38), leading to the resulting protagonist being less exploitable by new
adversaries. Finally, the work in (104) proposes certiﬁed lower bounds for the value predic-
tions from a DQN (103), given bounded observation perturbations. The action selection is
based on these value lower bounds, assuming adversarial perturbation.
Robustness Through Domain Randomization.
Domain randomization methods at-
tempt to learn policies that empirically generalize to a wider range of tasks or robot systems.
Instead of considering worst-case disturbances or scenarios, learning happens on systems
with randomly perturbed parameters (e.g., inertial properties, friction coeﬃcients). These
parameters often have pre-speciﬁed ranges, eﬀectively inducing a robust set that (i) ap-
proximates the uncertainty set D in Equation 13, and (ii) allows the system to reuse any
standard RL algorithm. As an example, in (105), a quadrotor learns vision-based ﬂight
purely in simulation from scenes with randomized properties. Using this model-free policy
in the real world resulted in improved collision avoidance performance. Instead of learning
a policy directly, the work in (106) uses learned visual predictions with a MPC controller
to enable eﬃcient and scalable real-world performance. Besides the uniform randomization
in (105, 106), adaptive randomization strategies such as Bayesian search (107) are also a
promising direction. In (108), a discriminator is adversarially trained and used to guide
the randomization process that generates systems that are less explored or exploited by the
current policy.
3.3. Certifying Learning-Based Control Under Dynamics Uncertainty
In this section, we review methods providing certiﬁcation to learning-based control ap-
proaches that do not inherently account for safety constraints, see Figure 2. We divide the
www.dynsyslab.org

## Page 19

discussion into two parts: (i) stability certiﬁcation, and (ii) constraint set certiﬁcation. The
works in this section leverage an a priori dynamics model of the system and provide hard
or probabilistic safety guarantees (Safety Level II or III) under dynamics uncertainties (see
Figure 4).
3.3.1. Stability Certiﬁcation. This section introduces certiﬁcation approaches that guaran-
tee closed-loop stability under a learning-based control policy.
Lipschitz-Based Safety Certiﬁcation for DNN-Based Learning Controllers. These
approaches exploit the expressive power of DNNs for policy parametrization and guaran-
tee closed-loop stability through a Lipschitz constraint on the DNN. Let ρ be a Lipschitz
constant of a DNN policy (see M12), an upper bound on the Lipschitz constant ρ that
guarantees closed-loop stability (Safety Level III) can be established by using a small-gain
stability analysis (109), solving a semi-deﬁnite program (SDP) (110), or applying a sliding
mode control framework (111). This bound on ρ can be used in either (i) a passive, iter-
ative enforcement approach where the Lipschitz constant ρ is ﬁrst estimated (e.g., via an
SDP-based estimation (112)) and then used to guide re-training until the Lipschitz con-
straint is satisﬁed, or (ii) an active enforcement approach where the Lipschitz constraint
is directly enforced by the training algorithm of the DNN (e.g., via spectral normaliza-
tion (111)). While guaranteeing stability, the Lipschitz-based certiﬁcation approaches often
rely on the particular structure of the system dynamics (e.g., a control-aﬃne structure or
linear structure with additive nonlinear uncertainty) to ﬁnd the certifying Lipschitz con-
stant.
It remains to be explored how this idea can be extended to more generic robot
systems.
Learning Regions of Attraction for Safety Certiﬁcation. The region of attraction
(ROA) of a closed-loop system (see M13) is used in the learning-based control literature as
a means to guarantee safety. For a nonlinear system with a given state-feedback controller,
the ROA is the set of states that is guaranteed to converge to the equilibrium, which is
treated as a safe state. This notion of safety provides a mean to certify a learning-based
controller. It guarantees that there is a region in state space from which the controller can
drive the system back to the safe state (Safety Level III) (113). ROAs can, for example, be
used to guide data acquisition for model or controller learning (68, 114).
We consider deterministic closed-loop systems xk+1 = fπ(xk) = f(xk, π(xk)) with
fπ(xk) being Lipschitz continuous.
A Lyapunov neural network (LNN) can be used to
iteratively learn the ROA of a controlled nonlinear system from the system’s input-output
data (113). As compared to the typical Lyapunov functions in control (e.g., quadratic Lya-
punov functions), the proposed method uses the LNN as a more ﬂexible Lyapunov function
representation to provide a less conservative estimate of the system’s ROA. The necessary
properties of a Lyapunov function are preserved via the network’s architectural design.
In (114), an ROA estimation approach for high-dimensional systems is presented, combin-
ing a sum of squares (SOS) programming method for the ROA computation (115) and a
dynamics model order reduction technique to curtail computational complexity (116).
3.3.2. Constraint Set Certiﬁcation. This section summarizes approaches that provide con-
straint set certiﬁcation to a learning-based controller based on the notion of robust positive
control invariant (RPCI) safe sets Ωsafe ⊆Xc (see M23). Certiﬁed learning, which can be

16b.
∀ˆfk(xk, uk, wk) ∈D(xk, uk) ,
where the range of possible disturbances D(xk, uk) is given.
Since the safety ﬁlter and
controller are usually decoupled, suboptimal behavior can emerge as the learning-based
controller may try to violate the constraints (65).
Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). CBFs are used to deﬁne safe sets. More speciﬁcally,
the safe set Ωsafe is deﬁned as the superlevel set of a continuously diﬀerentiable CBF Bc,
Bc : Rnx →R, as Ωsafe = {x ∈Rnx : Bc(x) ≥0}. The function Bc is generally considered
for continuous-time, control-aﬃne systems (see also M4) of the form:
˙x = fx(x) + fu(x)u ,
17.
where fx and fu are locally Lipschitz and x, u are functions of time (118). In the simplest
form, the function Bc is a CBF if there exists a state-feedback control input u, such that
the time derivative ˙Bc(x) = ∂Bc
∂x ˙x satisﬁes (118):
sup
u∈U
∂Bc
∂x (fx(x) + fu(x)u) ≥−Bc(x) .
18.
The CBF condition in Equation 18 is a continuous-time version of the robust positive
control invariance constraint in Equation 16b. In addition to the RPCI constraint, a similar

constraint for asymptotic stability can be added to Equation 16 in the form of a constraint on
the time derivative of a control Lyapunov function (CLF, see M24) Lc. However, uncertain
dynamics also yield uncertain time derivatives of Bc and Lc.
Learning-based approaches extend CBF and CLF analyses to control-aﬃne systems
in Equation 17 with known nominal ¯fx, ¯fu and unknown ˆfx, ˆfu. The time derivative of
the unknown dynamics for CLFs and/or CBFs (e.g., ∂Bc
∂x (ˆfx(x) + ˆfu(x)u)) can be learned
from iterative trials (119, 120) or data collected by an RL agent (121, 122).
Given a
CBF and/or CLF for the true dynamics f, improving the estimate of the CBF’s or CLF’s
time derivative for the unknown dynamics ˆf using data, collected either oﬄine or online,
yields a more precise estimate of the constraint in Equation 18. However, any learning
error in the CBF’s or CLF’s time derivative of the unknown dynamics can still lead to
applying falsely certiﬁed control inputs.
To this end, ideas from robust control can be
used to guarantee set invariance (Safety Level III) during the learning process by mapping
a bounded uncertainty in the dynamics to a bounded uncertainty in the time derivatives
of the CBF or CLF (123, 124), or by accounting for all model errors consistent with the
collected data (125).
In addition, adaptive control approaches have also been proposed
to allow safe adaptation of parametric uncertainties in the time derivatives of the CBF
or CLF (126, 127). Probabilistic learning techniques for CBFs and CLFs have been used
to achieve set invariance probabilistically (Safety Level II) with varying assumptions on
the system dynamics: the function fu(x) is fully known (128, 129), a nominal model is
known (130), and no nominal model is available (131).
Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis. Another approach for state constraint set cer-
tiﬁcation of a learning-based controller is via the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis.
The HJ reachability analysis provides a means to estimate a robust positive control invari-
ant safe set Ωsafe under dynamics uncertainties (see M23 and Equation 16). Consider a
nonlinear system subject to unknown but bounded disturbances ˆf(x) ∈D(x), where D(x) is
www.dynsyslab.org

## Page 21

assumed to be known but possibly conservative. To compute Ωsafe, a two-player, zero-sum
diﬀerential game is formulated:
V (x) =
max
usig∈Usig
min
ˆfsig∈Dsig

inf
k≥0 lc

φ(x, k; usig, ˆfsig)

,
19.
where V is the value function associated with a point x ∈X, lc : X 7→R is a cost function
that is non-negative for x ∈Xc and negative otherwise, φ(x, k; usig, ˆfsig) denotes the state at
k along a trajectory initialized at x following input signal usig and disturbance signal ˆfsig,
and Usig and Dsig are collections of input and disturbance signals such that each time
instance is in U and D, respectively. The value function V can be found as the unique
viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi Isaacs (HJI) variational inequality (132).
The
safe set is then Ωsafe = {x ∈X | V (x) ≥0}.
Based on this formulation, we can also
obtain an optimally safe policy π∗
safe that maximally steers the system towards the safe
set Ωsafe (i.e., in the greatest ascent direction of V ). The HJ reachability analysis allows
us to deﬁne a safety ﬁlter for learning-based control approaches to guarantee constraint set
satisfaction (Safety Level II or III). In particular, given Ωsafe and π∗
safe, one can safely learn
in the interior of Ωsafe and apply the optimally safe policy π∗
safe if the system reaches the
boundary of Ωsafe. To reduce the conservativeness of the approach, a GP-based learning
scheme is proposed in (133) to adapt (and shrink) the unknown dynamics set D(x) based
on observed data.
The general HJ reachability analysis framework (132) has also been combined with on-
line dynamics model learning for a target tracking task (134), with online planning for safe
exploration (135), and with temporal diﬀerence algorithms for safe RL (136). In
(137),
HJ reachability analysis and CBFs have been integrated to compute smoother control poli-
cies while circumventing the need to hand-design appropriate CBFs. Another recent ex-
tension (138) proposed modiﬁcations that improve the scalability of the HJ safety analy-
sis approach for higher-dimensional systems and was demonstrated on a ten-dimensional
quadrotor tracking problem.
Predictive Safety Filters. Predictive safety ﬁlters can augment any learning-based con-
troller to enforce state constraints, x ∈Xc, and input constraints, u ∈Uc. They do this by
deﬁning the safe invariant set Ωsafe in Equation 16b as the set of states (at the next time
step) where a sequence of safe control inputs (e.g., from a backup controller) exists that
allows the return to (i) a terminal safe set Xterm (see M25), or (ii) to previously visited safe
states.
Model Predictive Safety Certiﬁcation (MPSC) uses the theory of robust MPC
in Sec. 2.2 and learning-based robust MPC in Sec. 3.1.3 to ﬁlter the output of any learning-
based controller, such as of an RL method, to ensure robust constraint satisfaction. The
simplest implementation of MPSC (139) uses tube-based MPC and considers the constraints
in Equations 12b–12d but replaces the cost in Equation 12a with the cost in Equation 16a
to ﬁnd the closest input uk to the learned input ulearn,k at the current time step that
guarantees that we will continue to satisfy state and input constraints in the future. The
main diﬀerence between MPSC and learning-based robust MPC described in Sec. 3.1.3 is
that the terminal safe set Xterm in Equation 12d is not coupled with the selection of the cost
function in Equation 12a. Instead, the terminal safe set is conservatively initialized with
Xterm = Ωtube and can grow to include state trajectories from previous iterations. This
approach has been extended to probabilistic constraints by considering a probabilistic tube
Ωtube in (140), and to nonlinear nominal models in (141) (Safety Level II).

A terminal
safe set, denoted
by Xterm, is a subset
of the safe state

to the state constraints Xc, the backup controller is used to obtain a future state in the

4. BENCHMARKS
The approaches presented in Sec. 3 have been evaluated in vastly diﬀerent ways, see Fig-
ure 5. The trends we observe are: The works learning uncertain dynamics (Sec. 3.1) include
a preponderance of abstract numerical examples; encouraging safety in RL (Sec. 3.2) mostly
leverages simulations—often based on physics engines (144) like MuJoCo—but grid worlds
are also common; and works certifying learning-based control (Sec. 3.3) are still mostly
simulated but also has the largest fraction of real-world experiments.
While numerical
examples make it diﬃcult to gauge the practical applicability of a method, we also note
that even many RL environments, including physics-based ones, are not representative of
existing robotic platforms–for example, they often are deterministic and do not account for
variations in the environment.
In an ideal world, all research would be demonstrated in simulations that closely re-
semble the target system—and brought to (ideally diﬀerent) real robots, whenever possi-
ble. Furthermore, only a minority of the published research open-sourced their software
implementations.
Even in RL, where sharing code is more common (see, e.g., red bars
in Figure 5)—and standard environments and interfaces such as gym (145) have been
proposed—the reproducibility of results (that often rely on careful hyper-parameter tun-
ing) remains challenging (71). With regard to safety, simple RL environments augmented
with constraint evaluation (18) and disturbances (5) have been proposed, but lack a uniﬁed
simulation interface for both safe RL and learning-based control approaches—notably, one
that also exposes the available a priori knowledge of a dynamical system.
We believe that a necessary stepping stone for the advancement of safe learning control
is to create physics-based environments that are (i) simple enough to promote adoption,
(ii) realistic enough to represent meaningful robotic platforms, (iii) equipped with intuitive
interfaces for both control and RL researchers, and (iv) provide useful comparison metrics
(e.g., the amount of data required by diﬀerent approaches).

Cart-Pole and Quadrotor Benchmark Environments. For this reason, we have created
an open-source benchmark suite2 simulating two popular platforms for the evaluation of
control and RL research: (i) the cart-pole (64, 104, 136) and (ii) a quadrotor (142, 66,
44, 130, 146). Our simulation environments are based on the open-source Bullet physics
engine (147) and we adopt OpenAI’s gym interface (API) (145) for seamless integration
with many of the current RL libraries. What sets apart our implementation from previous
attempts to create safety-aware RL environments (18, 5) is the extension of the traditional
API (145) with features to facilitate: (i) the evaluation of safe learning control approaches
(such as the randomization of inertial properties and of initial positions and velocities,
random and adversarial disturbances, and the speciﬁcation and evaluation of state and
input constraints) and (ii) the integration with approaches developed by the control theory
community that leverage the knowledge of nominal models—notably, we use the symbolic
framework CasADi (148) to enrich our gym environments with symbolic a priori dynamics,
constraints, and cost functions.
Safe Learning Control Results. We focus on a constrained stabilization task, in each of
our environments (cartpole and quadrotor). The results we present here are not meant
to establish the superiority of one approach over another. Instead, we show how the ap-
proaches in (63, 70, 139), taken from each of Sec. 3.1 (learning uncertain dynamics), Sec. 3.2
(encouraging safety in RL), and Sec. 3.3 (certifying learning-based control), can improve

control performance while pursuing constraint satisfaction. By doing so, we demonstrate
that our benchmark can be easily integrated with learnable policies developed by either the
control or RL research community. This also allows us to fairly compare the data hungriness
of the diﬀerent safe learning control approaches.
A learning-based robust MPC with a GP estimate of ˆf (GP-MPC), representative of
Sec. 3.1 (learning uncertain dynamics), was implemented to stabilize a quadrotor subject
to a state and input constraints, following the approach in (63).
For this experiment,
a linearization about hover with a mass and moment of inertia 150% of the true values
was used as the prior model. Eight-hundred randomly selected state-action pairs (or 80
seconds), sampled from a couple of minutes of training data, were used for hyper-parameter
optimization, which was performed oﬄine. Figure 6 compares the performance of a linear
MPC, using the inaccurate prior model, with the GP-MPC approach.
We see that the
Linear MPC, using the heavier prior model, predicts the trajectory of the quadrotor will be
relatively shallow when maximum thrust is applied. This results in the quadrotor quickly
violating the position constraint.
In contrast, the GP-MPC is able to account for the
inaccurate prior model and respects the constraint boundary by a margin proportional to
the 95% conﬁdence interval on its dynamics prediction, stabilizing the quadrotor.
We also applied the Safe Exploration approach (70) to the popular deep RL algorithm
PPO (149), as a representative of Sec. 3.2 (encouraging safety in RL), and tested it on
the cart-pole stabilization task with constraints on the cart position. Notably, the task
terminates upon any constraint violation.
We compared it against two baselines, stan-
dard PPO and PPO with naive cost shaping (adding a penalty when close to constraint
violation).
Each RL approach used over 9 hours of simulation time collecting data for
training. Figure 7 shows that the two constraint-aware approaches (cost shaping and safe
exploration (70)) achieve the same performance after learning, but with substantially lower
constraint violations than the standard PPO. The safe exploration approach outperforms
cost shaping in terms of constraint satisfaction, while not compromising convergence speed
towards reaching the optimal cost. Safe Exploration, however, requires careful parameter
tuning, especially on the slack variable that determines its responsiveness to near constraint
violation.
Finally, a Model Predictive Safety Certiﬁcation (MPSC) algorithm, based on (139), was
chosen as a representative of Sec. 3.3 (certifying learning-based control). This particular
formulation uses an MPC framework to modify an unsafe learning controller’s actions. Here,
a sub-optimal PPO controller provides the uncertiﬁed inputs trying to stabilize the cart-
pole. The advantages of using MPSC are highlighted in Figure 8. In Figure 8 (right), the
inputs are modiﬁed by the MPSC early in the stabilization to keep the cart-pole within the

constraint boundaries. Figure 8 (left) shows that, without the MPSC, PPO violates the
constraints, but with MPSC, it manages to stay within the boundaries. The plot also shows
that MPSC is most active when the system is close to the constraint boundaries (the green
dots show when MPSC modiﬁed the learning controller’s input). This provides a proof of
concept of how safety ﬁlters can be combined with RL control for safer performance.
In our future work, we intend to use our cartpole and quadrotor benchmark envi-
ronments to evaluate the robustness, performance, safety and data eﬃciency of diﬀerent
control and learning approaches.
5. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES FOR FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The problem of safe learning control is emerging as a crucial topic for next-generation
robotics.
In this review, we summarized approaches from the control and the machine
learning communities that allow data to be safely used to improve the closed-loop perfor-
mance of robot control systems. We show that machine learning techniques, particularly
RL, can help generalization towards larger classes of systems (i.e., fewer prior model as-
sumptions), while control theory provides the insights and frameworks necessary to provide
constraint satisfaction guarantees and closed-loop stability guarantees during the learning.
Despite the many advances to date, there remain many opportunities for future research.
OPEN CHALLENGES
1. Capturing a Broader Class of Systems. Work to date has focused on nonlinear
systems in the form of Equation 1. While they can model many robotic platforms,
robots can also exhibit hybrid dynamics (e.g., legged robots or other contact dynam-
ics with the environment (150)), time-varying dynamics (e.g., operation in changing
environments (151, 152)), time delays (e.g., in actuation, sensing, or observing the
reward (6)), partial diﬀerential dependencies in the dynamics (e.g., in continuum
robotics (153)). Expanding safe learning control approaches to these scenarios is
essential for their broader applicability in robotics (see Figure 4).
2. Accounting for Imperfect State Measurements. The majority of safe learn-
ing control approaches assume direct access to (possibly noisy) state measurements
and neglect the problem of state estimation. In practice, obtaining accurate state
information is challenging due to sensors that do not provide state measurements
directly (e.g., images as measurements), inaccurate process and observation models
used for state estimation, and/or improper state feature representations. One open
challenge is to account for state estimation errors and learned process and observa-
tion models in safe learning control (143). Expanding existing approaches to work
with (possibly high-dimensional) sensor data is essential for a broad applicability
of these methods in robotics.
3. Considering Scalability, and Sampling and Computational Eﬃciency.
Many of the approaches presented here have only been demonstrated on small
toy problems and applying them to high-dimensional robotics problems is not triv-
ial. Moreover, in practice, we often face issues such as data sparsity, distribution
shifts, and the optimality-complexity trade-oﬀfor real-time implementations. Ef-
ﬁcient robot learning relies on multiple factors including control architecture de-
sign (154), systematic training data collection (155), and appropriate function class
selection (156).
While current approaches focus on providing theoretical safety
guarantees, formal analysis of sampling complexity and computational complexity
is indispensable to facilitate the implementation of safe learning control algorithms
in real-world robot applications.
Safe Learning in Robotics

## Page 26

4. Verifying System and Modeling Assumptions. The safety guarantees pro-
vided often rely on a set of assumptions (e.g., Lipschitz continuous true dynamics
with a known Lipschitz constant or bounded disturbance sets). It is diﬃcult to
verify these assumptions prior to a robot’s operation. To facilitate algorithm imple-
mentation, we also see other approximations being made (e.g., linearization, data
assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian samples).
Systematic approaches to verify or quantify the impact of the assumptions and the
approximations with minimal (online) data are crucial to allow the safe learning
approaches to be applied in real-world applications. This can also include investi-
gations into the interpretability of trained models, especially black-box models such
as DNNs, for safe closed-loop operation (6).
This list of challenges is by no means complete. Other important and open questions
pertinent to safe learning control are:
• What are the appropriate benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and practices to
provide practical insights and perform fair comparisons of algorithms that rely on
diﬀerent assumptions?
• What should be the role of simulation in the oﬄine design and evaluation phases?
Can simulation be used to ﬁnd safe hyperparameters?
• How do we deﬁne safety in human-robot interaction?
• How can data be safely used in multi-agent learning settings?
Eﬀorts that combine control theory and machine learning for safe learning control have
been shown to result in improved control performance and system safety. Recent successes
and growing interest should motivate the further development of a systematic body of
theory, advanced methodologies, and computational methods for safe learning in robotics,
bringing the large potential of learning into safety-critical control and robotics applications.
The open challenges and questions are intended to push us further, towards a future of real-
world safe autonomy where robots reliably and safely function in complex environments.

A. SUMMARY OF REVIEWED LITERATURE
Table 1 summarizes the safe learning control approaches reviewed in this paper. Learning
approaches are classiﬁed as Model-Based if a dynamics model is used to produce control
inputs or Model-Free if there is a direct mapping from states or measurements to control
inputs. For model-based approaches, we categorize the structure of the A Priori and the
Learned component of the model as Gaussian process (GP), neural network (NN ), or Other
for non-standard methods (e.g., set computation from data).
The Safety Properties category highlights which algorithms can handle state and/or
input constraints (Constraint Satisfaction) and which ones provide stability guarantees
(Stability). For both of these properties, we report whether they are enforced while the
policy is being trained (During Learning) or by the resultant policy (After Learning). The
Robustness category indicates whether the ﬁnal policy is designed to be robust to Input
disturbances; model Parameter uncertainty, and/or other Dynamics uncertainties broader
than the previous two types of disturbances.
Finally, the last category reports the Task(s) to which each method was applied: Sta-
bilization for stabilizing an equilibrium of the system; Tracking for the tracking of a given
trajectory; Navigation for navigating or planning a sequence of actions to reach a given
goal; Locomotion for the movement of legged robots like humanoids or quadrupeds; and
Manipulation for pushing, reaching, or grasping operations using a robotic arm.
