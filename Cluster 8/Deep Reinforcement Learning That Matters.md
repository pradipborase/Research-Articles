Abstract
In recent years, signiﬁcant progress has been made in solving
challenging problems across various domains using deep re-
inforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and
accurately judging the improvements offered by novel meth-
ods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, repro-
ducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom
straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard
benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic
to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret.
Without signiﬁcance metrics and tighter standardization of
experimental reporting, it is difﬁcult to determine whether im-
provements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In
this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility,
proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We
illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when
comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines
to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim
to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in
the ﬁeld by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results
that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.
Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the study of how an agent
can interact with its environment to learn a policy which
maximizes expected cumulative rewards for a task. Recently,
RL has experienced dramatic growth in attention and interest
due to promising results in areas like: controlling continuous
systems in robotics (Lillicrap et al. 2015a), playing Go (Silver
et al. 2016), Atari (Mnih et al. 2013), and competitive video
games (Vinyals et al. 2017; Silva and Chaimowicz 2017).
Figure 1 illustrates growth of the ﬁeld through the number
of publications per year. To maintain rapid progress in RL
research, it is important that existing works can be easily
reproduced and compared to accurately judge improvements
offered by novel methods.
However, reproducing deep RL results is seldom straight-
forward, and the literature reports a wide range of results
for the same baseline algorithms (Islam et al. 2017). Re-
producibility can be affected by extrinsic factors (e.g. hy-
perparameters or codebases) and intrinsic factors (e.g. ef-

fects of random seeds or environment properties). We inves-
tigate these sources of variance in reported results through
a representative set of experiments. For clarity, we focus
our investigation on policy gradient (PG) methods in con-
tinuous control. Policy gradient methods with neural net-
work function approximators have been particularly suc-
cessful in continuous control (Schulman et al. 2015a; 2017;
Lillicrap et al. 2015b) and are competitive with value-based
methods in discrete settings. We note that the diversity of
metrics and lack of signiﬁcance testing in the RL literature
creates the potential for misleading reporting of results. We
demonstrate possible beneﬁts of signiﬁcance testing using
techniques common in machine learning and statistics.
Several works touch upon evaluating RL algorithms. Duan
et al. (2016) benchmark several RL algorithms and provide
the community with baseline implementations. Generaliz-
able RL evaluation metrics are proposed in (Whiteson et al.
2011). Machado et al. (2017) revisit the Arcade Learning
Environment to propose better evaluation methods in these
benchmarks. However, while the question of reproducibility
and good experimental practice has been examined in related
ﬁelds (Wagstaff 2012; Boulesteix, Lauer, and Eugster 2013;
Stodden, Leisch, and Peng 2014; Bouckaert and Frank 2004;
Bouckaert 2004; Vaughan and Wawerla 2012), to the best of
our knowledge this is the ﬁrst work to address this important
question in the context of deep RL.
In each section of our experimental analysis, we pose ques-
tions regarding key factors affecting reproducibility. We ﬁnd
that there are numerous sources of non-determinism when
reproducing and comparing RL algorithms. To this end, we

show that ﬁne details of experimental procedure can be crit-
ical. Based on our experiments, we conclude with possible
recommendations, lines of investigation, and points of dis-
cussion for future works to ensure that deep reinforcement
learning is reproducible and continues to matter.
Technical Background
This work focuses on several model-free policy gradient
algorithms with publicly available implementations which
appear frequently in the literature as baselines for compar-
ison against novel methods. We experiment with Trust Re-
gion Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al. 2015a),
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) (Lillicrap et
al. 2015b), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman
et al. 2017), and Actor Critic using Kronecker-Factored
Trust Region (ACKTR) (Wu et al. 2017). These methods
have shown promising results in continuous control MuJoCo
domain tasks (Todorov, Erez, and Tassa 2012) from Ope-
nAI Gym (Brockman et al. 2016). Generally, they optimize
ρ(θ, s0) = Eπθ [∞
t=0 γtr(st)|s0], using the policy gradient
theorem:
δρ(θ,s0)
δθ
= 
s μπθ(s|s0) 
a
δπθ(a|s)
δθ
Qπθ(s, a).
Here, μπθ(s|s0) = ∞
t=0 γtP(st = s|s0) (Sutton et al.
2000). TRPO (Schulman et al. 2015a) and PPO (Schulman
et al. 2017) use constraints and advantage estimation to per-
form this update, reformulating the optimization problem
as: maxθ Et

πθ(at|st)
πθold(at|st)At(st, at)

. Here, At is the general-
ized advantage function (Schulman et al. 2015b). TRPO uses
conjugate gradient descent as the optimization method with
a KL constraint: Et [KL [πθold(·|st), πθ(·|st)]] ≤δ. PPO re-
formulates the constraint as a penalty (or clipping objective).
DDPG and ACKTR use actor-critic methods which estimate
Q(s, a) and optimize a policy that maximizes the Q-function
based on Monte-Carlo rollouts. DDPG does this using deter-
ministic policies, while ACKTR uses Kronecketer-factored
trust regions to ensure stability with stochastic policies.
Experimental Analysis
We pose several questions about the factors affecting repro-
ducibility of state-of-the-art RL methods. We perform a set
of experiments designed to provide insight into the questions
posed. In particular, we investigate the effects of: speciﬁc
hyperparameters on algorithm performance if not properly
tuned; random seeds and the number of averaged experi-
ment trials; speciﬁc environment characteristics; differences
in algorithm performance due to stochastic environments;
differences due to codebases with most other factors held
constant. For most of our experiments1, except for those com-
paring codebases, we generally use the OpenAI Baselines2
implementations of the following algorithms: ACKTR (Wu
et al. 2017), PPO (Schulman et al. 2017), DDPG (Plappert et
al. 2017), TRPO (Schulman et al. 2017). We use the Hopper-
v1 and HalfCheetah-v1 MuJoCo (Todorov, Erez, and Tassa
2012) environments from OpenAI Gym (Brockman et al.
1Speciﬁc details can be found in the supplemental and code can
be found at: https://git.io/vFHnf
2https://www.github.com/openai/baselines
2016). These two environments provide contrasting dynam-
ics (the former being more unstable).
To ensure fairness we run ﬁve experiment trials for each
evaluation, each with a different preset random seed (all
experiments use the same set of random seeds). In all cases,
we highlight important results here, with full descriptions of
experimental setups and additional learning curves included
in the supplemental material. Unless otherwise mentioned,
we use default settings whenever possible, while modifying
only the hyperparameters of interest.
We use multilayer perceptron function approximators in
all cases. We denote the hidden layer sizes and activations
as (N, M, activation). For default settings, we vary the hy-
perparameters under investigation one at a time. For DDPG
we use a network structure of (64, 64, ReLU) for both actor
and critic. For TRPO and PPO, we use (64, 64, tanh) for the
policy. For ACKTR, we use (64, 64, tanh) for the actor and
(64, 64, ELU) for the critic.
Hyperparameters
What is the magnitude of the effect hyperparameter settings
can have on baseline performance?
Tuned hyperparameters play a large role in eliciting the best
results from many algorithms. However, the choice of op-
timal hyperparameter conﬁguration is often not consistent
in related literature, and the range of values considered is
often not reported3. Furthermore, poor hyperparameter selec-
tion can be detrimental to a fair comparison against baseline
algorithms. Here, we investigate several aspects of hyperpa-
rameter selection on performance.
Network Architecture
How does the choice of network architecture for the policy
and value function approximation affect performance?
In (Islam et al. 2017), it is shown that policy network architec-
ture can signiﬁcantly impact results in both TRPO and DDPG.
Furthermore, certain activation functions such as Rectiﬁed
Linear Unit (ReLU) have been shown to cause worsened
learning performance due to the “dying relu” problem (Xu et
al. 2015). As such, we examine network architecture and ac-
tivation functions for both policy and value function approxi-
mators. In the literature, similar lines of investigation have
shown the differences in performance when comparing linear
approximators, RBFs, and neural networks (Rajeswaran et
al. 2017). Tables 1 and 2 summarize the ﬁnal evaluation per-
formance of all architectural variations after training on 2M
samples (i.e. 2M timesteps in the environment). All learning
curves and details on setup can be found in the supplemental
material. We vary hyperparameters one at a time, while using
a default setting for all others. We investigate three multilayer
perceptron (MLP) architectures commonly seen in the liter-
ature: (64, 64), (100, 50, 25), and (400, 300). Furthermore,
we vary the activation functions of both the value and policy
networks across tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU activations.
Results Figure 2 shows how signiﬁcantly performance can
be affected by simple changes to the policy or value network

activations. We ﬁnd that usually ReLU or Leaky ReLU acti-
vations perform the best across environments and algorithms.
The effects are not consistent across algorithms or environ-
ments. This inconsistency demonstrates how interconnected
network architecture is to algorithm methodology. For exam-
ple, using a large network with PPO may require tweaking
other hyperparameters such as the trust region clipping or
learning rate to compensate for the architectural change4.
This intricate interplay of hyperparameters is one of the rea-
sons reproducing current policy gradient methods is so dif-
ﬁcult. It is exceedingly important to choose an appropriate
architecture for proper baseline results. This also suggests a
possible need for hyperparameter agnostic algorithms—that
is algorithms that incorporate hyperparameter adaptation as
part of the design—such that fair comparisons can be made
without concern about improper settings for the task at hand.
Reward Scale
How can the reward scale affect results? Why is reward
rescaling used?
Reward rescaling has been used in several recent works
(Duan et al. 2016; Gu et al. 2016) to improve results for
DDPG. This involves simply multiplying the rewards gen-
erated from an environment by some scalar (ˆr = rˆσ) for
training. Often, these works report using a reward scale
of ˆσ = 0.1. In Atari domains, this is akin to clipping the
rewards to [0, 1]. By intuition, in gradient based methods
(as used in most deep RL) a large and sparse output scale
can result in problems regarding saturation and inefﬁciency
in learning (LeCun et al. 2012; Glorot and Bengio 2010;
Vincent, de Br´ebisson, and Bouthillier 2015). Therefore clip-
ping or rescaling rewards compresses the space of estimated
4We ﬁnd that the KL divergence of updates with the large net-
work (400, 300) seen in Figure 2 is on average 33.52 times higher
than the KL divergence of updates with the (64, 64) network.
expected returns in action value function based methods such
as DDPG. We run a set of experiments using reward rescaling
in DDPG (with and without layer normalization) for insights
into how this aspect affects performance.
Results Our analysis shows that reward rescaling can have
a large effect (full experiment results can be found in the
supplemental material), but results were inconsistent across
environments and scaling values. Figure 3 shows one such ex-
ample where reward rescaling affects results, causing a failure
to learn in small settings below ˆσ = 0.01. In particular, layer
normalization changes how the rescaling factor affects results,
suggesting that these impacts are due to the use of deep net-
works and gradient-based methods. With the value function
approximator tracking a moving target distribution, this can
potentially affect learning in unstable environments where
a deep Q-value function approximator is used. Furthermore,
some environments may have untuned reward scales (e.g.
the HumanoidStandup-v1 of OpenAI gym which can reach
rewards in the scale of millions). Therefore, we suggest that
this hyperparameter has the potential to have a large impact
if considered properly. Rather than rescaling rewards in some
environments, a more principled approach should be taken
to address this. An initial foray into this problem is made
in (van Hasselt et al. 2016), where the authors adaptively
rescale reward targets with normalized stochastic gradient,
but further research is needed.
Random Seeds and Trials
Can random seeds drastically alter performance? Can one
distort results by averaging an improper number of trials?
A major concern with deep RL is the variance in results due
to environment stochasticity or stochasticity in the learning
process (e.g. random weight initialization). As such, even
averaging several learning results together across totally dif-
ferent random seeds can lead to the reporting of misleading
results. We highlight this in the form of an experiment.

tributions just from varying random seeds. Unfortunately, in
recent reported results, it is not uncommon for the top-N tri-
als to be selected from among several trials (Wu et al. 2017;
Mnih et al. 2016) or averaged over only small number of tri-
als (N < 5) (Gu et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017). Our experiment
with random seeds shows that this can be potentially mislead-
ing. Particularly for HalfCheetah, it is possible to get learning
curves that do not fall within the same distribution at all, just
by averaging different runs with the same hyperparameters,
but different random seeds. While there can be no speciﬁc
number of trials speciﬁed as a recommendation, it is possible
that power analysis methods can be used to give a general
idea to this extent as we will discuss later. However, more
investigation is needed to answer this open problem.
Environments
How do the environment properties affect variability in re-
ported RL algorithm performance?
To assess how the choice of evaluation environment can af-
fect the presented results, we use our aforementioned default
set of hyperparameters across our chosen testbed of algo-
rithms and investigate how well each algorithm performs
across an extended suite of continuous control tasks. For
these experiments, we use the following environments from
OpenAI Gym: Hopper-v1, HalfCheetah-v1, Swimmer-v1 and
Walker2d-v1. The choice of environment often plays an im-
portant role in demonstrating how well a new proposed algo-
rithm performs against baselines. In continuous control tasks,
often the environments have random stochasticity, shortened
trajectories, or different dynamic properties. We demonstrate
that, as a result of these differences, algorithm performance
can vary across environments and the best performing algo-
rithm across all environments is not always clear. Thus it is
increasingly important to present results for a wide range of
environments and not only pick those which show a novel
work outperforming other methods.
Results As shown in Figure 4, in environments with sta-
ble dynamics (e.g. HalfCheetah-v1), DDPG outperforms all
other algorithsm. However, as dynamics become more unsta-
ble (e.g. in Hopper-v1) performance gains rapidly diminish.
As DDPG is an off-policy method, exploration noise can
cause sudden failures in unstable environments. Therefore,
learning a proper Q-value estimation of expected returns is
difﬁcult, particularly since many exploratory paths will result
in failure. Since failures in such tasks are characterized by
shortened trajectories, a local optimum in this case would be
simply to survive until the maximum length of the trajectory
(corresponding to one thousand timesteps and similar reward
due to a survival bonus in the case of Hopper-v1). As can be
seen in Figure 4, DDPG with Hopper does exactly this. This
is a clear example where showing only the favourable and sta-
ble HalfCheetah when reporting DDPG-based experiments
would be unfair.
Furthermore, let us consider the Swimmer-v1 environment
shown in Figure 4. Here, TRPO signiﬁcantly outperforms
all other algorithms. Due to the dynamics of the water-like
environment, a local optimum for the system is to curl up and
ﬂail without proper swimming. However, this corresponds
to a return of ∼130. By reaching a local optimum, learning
curves can indicate successful optimization of the policy over
time, when in reality the returns achieved are not qualitatively
representative of learning the desired behaviour, as demon-
strated in video replays of the learned policy5. Therefore,
it is important to show not only returns but demonstrations
of the learned policy in action. Without understanding what
the evaluation returns indicate, it is possible that misleading
results can be reported which in reality only optimize local
optima rather than reaching the desired behaviour.
Codebases
Are commonly used baseline implementations comparable?
In many cases, authors implement their own versions of base-
line algorithms to compare against. We investigate the Ope-
nAI baselines implementation of TRPO as used in (Schulman
et al. 2017), the original TRPO code (Schulman et al. 2015a),
and the rllab (Duan et al. 2016) Tensorﬂow implementation of
TRPO. We also compare the rllab Theano (Duan et al. 2016),
rllabplusplus (Gu et al. 2016), and OpenAI baselines (Plap-
pert et al. 2017) implementations of DDPG. Our goal is to
draw attention to the variance due to implementation details
across algorithms. We run a subset of our architecture experi-
ments as with the OpenAI baselines implementations using
the same hyperparameters as in those experiments6.
Results We ﬁnd that implementation differences which
are often not reﬂected in publications can have dramatic
impacts on performance. This can be seen for our ﬁnal evalu-
ation performance after training on 2M samples in Tables 1
5https://youtu.be/lKpUQYjgm80
6Differences are discussed in the supplemental (e.g. use of dif-
ferent optimizers for the value function baseline). Leaky ReLU
activations are left out to narrow the experiment scope.

Reporting Evaluation Metrics
In this section we analyze some of the evaluation metrics
commonly used in the reinforcement learning literature. In
practice, RL algorithms are often evaluated by simply pre-
senting plots or tables of average cumulative reward (average
returns) and, more recently, of maximum reward achieved
over a ﬁxed number of timesteps. Due to the unstable na-
ture of many of these algorithms, simply reporting the max-
imum returns is typically inadequate for fair comparison;
even reporting average returns can be misleading as the range
of performance across seeds and trials is unknown. Alone,
these may not provide a clear picture of an algorithm’s range
of performance. However, when combined with conﬁdence
intervals, this may be adequate to make an informed deci-
sion given a large enough number of trials. As such, we
investigate using the bootstrap and signiﬁcance testing as in
ML (Kohavi and others 1995; Bouckaert and Frank 2004;
Nadeau and Bengio 2000) to evaluate algorithm performance.
Online View vs. Policy Optimization An important dis-
tinction when reporting results is the online learning view
versus the policy optimization view of RL. In the online view,
an agent will optimize the returns across the entire learning
process and there is not necessarily an end to the agent’s
trajectory. In this view, evaluations can use the average cumu-
lative rewards across the entire learning process (balancing
exploration and exploitation) as in (Hofer and Gimbert 2016),
or can possibly use ofﬂine evaluation as in (Mandel et al.
2016). The alternate view corresponds to policy optimization,
where evaluation is performed using a target policy in an of-
ﬂine manner. In the policy optimization view it is important to
run evaluations across the entire length of the task trajectory
with a single target policy to determine the average returns
that the target can obtain. We focus on evaluation methods
for the policy optimization view (with ofﬂine evaluation), but
the same principles can be applied to the online view.
Conﬁdence Bounds The sample bootstrap has been a pop-
ular method to gain insight into a population distribution
from a smaller sample (Efron and Tibshirani 1994). Boot-
strap methods are particularly popular for A/B testing, and
we can borrow some ideas from this ﬁeld. Generally a boot-
strap estimator is obtained by resampling with replacement
many times to generate a statistically relevant mean and con-
ﬁdence bound. Using this technique, we can gain insight into
what is the 95% conﬁdence interval of the results from our
section on environments. Table 3 shows the bootstrap mean
and 95% conﬁdence bounds on our environment experiments.
Conﬁdence intervals can vary wildly between algorithms and
environments. We ﬁnd that TRPO and PPO are the most
stable with small conﬁdence bounds from the bootstrap. In
cases where conﬁdence bounds are exceedingly large, it may
be necessary to run more trials (i.e. increase the sample size).
Power Analysis Another method to determine if the
sample size must be increased is bootstrap power analy-
sis (Tuff´ery 2011; Yuan and Hayashi 2003). If we use our
sample and give it some uniform lift (for example, scaling uni-
formly by 1.25), we can run many bootstrap simulations and
determine what percentage of the simulations result in statis-
tically signiﬁcant values with the lift. If there is a small per-
centage of signiﬁcant values, a larger sample size is needed
(more trials must be run). We do this across all environment
experiment trial runs and indeed ﬁnd that, in more unstable
settings, the bootstrap power percentage leans towards in-
signiﬁcant results in the lift experiment. Conversely, in stable
trials (e.g. TRPO on Hopper-v1) with a small sample size,
the lift experiment shows that no more trials are needed to
generate signiﬁcant comparisons. These results are provided
in the supplemental material.
Signiﬁcance An important factor when deciding on an
RL algorithm to use is the signiﬁcance of the reported gains
based on a given metric. Several works have investigated
the use of signiﬁcance metrics to assess the reliability of
reported evaluation metrics in ML. However, few works in
reinforcement learning assess the signiﬁcance of reported
metrics. Based on our experimental results which indicate
that algorithm performance can vary wildly based simply on
perturbations of random seeds, it is clear that some metric is
necessary for assessing the signiﬁcance of algorithm perfor-
mance gains and the conﬁdence of reported metrics. While
more research and investigation is needed to determine the
best metrics for assessing RL algorithms, we investigate an
initial set of metrics based on results from ML.
In supervised learning, k-fold t-test, corrected resampled t-
test, and other signiﬁcance metrics have been discussed when
comparing machine learning results (Bouckaert and Frank
2004; Nadeau and Bengio 2000). However, the assumptions
pertaining to the underlying data with corrected metrics do
not necessarily apply in RL. Further work is needed to inves-
tigate proper corrected signiﬁcance tests for RL. Nonetheless,
3212

## Page 7

we explore several signiﬁcance measures which give insight
into whether a novel algorithm is truly performing as the state-
of-the-art. We consider the simple 2-sample t-test (sorting all
ﬁnal evaluation returns across N random trials with different
random seeds); the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Wilcox 2005);
and bootstrap percent differences with 95% conﬁdence in-
tervals. All calculated metrics can be found in the supple-
mental. Generally, we ﬁnd that the signiﬁcance values match
up to what is to be expected. Take, for example, comparing
Walker2d-v1 performance of ACKTR vs. DDPG. ACKTR
performs slightly better, but this performance is not signiﬁ-
cant due to the overlapping conﬁdence intervals of the two:
t = 1.03, p = 0.334, KS = 0.40, p = 0.697, bootstrapped
percent difference 44.47% (-80.62%, 111.72%).
Discussion and Conclusion
Through experimental methods focusing on PG methods
for continuous control, we investigate problems with repro-
ducibility in deep RL. We ﬁnd that both intrinsic (e.g. random
seeds, environment properties) and extrinsic sources (e.g. hy-
perparameters, codebases) of non-determinism can contribute
to difﬁculties in reproducing baseline algorithms. Moreover,
we ﬁnd that highly varied results due to intrinsic sources
bolster the need for using proper signiﬁcance analysis. We
propose several such methods and show their value on a
subset of our experiments.
What recommendations can we draw from our experiments?
Based on our experimental results and investigations, we
can provide some general recommendations. Hyperparame-
ters can have signiﬁcantly different effects across algorithms
and environments. Thus it is important to ﬁnd the work-
ing set which at least matches the original reported perfor-
mance of baseline algorithms through standard hyperparame-
ter searches. Similarly, new baseline algorithm implementa-
tions used for comparison should match the original codebase
results if available. Overall, due to the high variance across
trials and random seeds of reinforcement learning algorithms,
many trials must be run with different random seeds when
comparing performance. Unless random seed selection is
explicitly part of the algorithm, averaging multiple runs over
different random seeds gives insight into the population dis-
tribution of the algorithm performance on an environment.
Similarly, due to these effects, it is important to perform
proper signiﬁcance testing to determine if the higher average
returns are in fact representative of better performance.
We highlight several forms of signiﬁcance testing and ﬁnd
that they give generally expected results when taking conﬁ-
dence intervals into consideration. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that bootstrapping and power analysis are possible ways
to gain insight into the number of trial runs necessary to make
an informed decision about the signiﬁcance of algorithm per-
formance gains. In general, however, the most important step
to reproducibility is to report all hyperparameters, implemen-
tation details, experimental setup, and evaluation methods for
both baseline comparison methods and novel work. Without
the publication of implementations and related details, wasted
effort on reproducing state-of-the-art works will plague the
community and slow down progress.
What are possible future lines of investigation?
Due to the signiﬁcant effects of hyperparameters (partic-
ularly reward scaling), another possibly important line of
future investigation is in building hyperparameter agnostic
algorithms. Such an approach would ensure that there is no
unfairness introduced from external sources when compar-
ing algorithms agnostic to parameters such as reward scale,
batch size, or network structure. Furthermore, while we in-
vestigate an initial set of signiﬁcance metrics here, they may
not be the best ﬁt for comparing RL algorithms. Several
works have begun investigating policy evaluation methods
for the purposes of safe RL (Thomas and Brunskill 2016;
Thomas, Theocharous, and Ghavamzadeh 2015), but further
work is needed in signiﬁcance testing and statistical analysis.
Similar lines of investigation to (Nadeau and Bengio 2000;
Bouckaert and Frank 2004) would be helpful to determine the
best methods for evaluating performance gain signiﬁcance.
How can we ensure that deep RL matters?
We discuss many different factors affecting reproducibility of
RL algorithms. The sensitivity of these algorithms to changes
in reward scale, environment dynamics, and random seeds
can be considerable and varies between algorithms and set-
tings. Since benchmark environments are proxies for real-
world applications to gauge generalized algorithm perfor-
mance, perhaps more emphasis should be placed on the appli-
cability of RL algorithms to real-world tasks. That is, as there
is often no clear winner among all benchmark environments,
perhaps recommended areas of application should be demon-
strated along with benchmark environment results when pre-
senting a new algorithm. Maybe new methods should be
answering the question: in what setting would this work be
useful? This is something that is addressed for machine learn-
ing in (Wagstaff 2012) and may warrant more discussion for
RL. As a community, we must not only ensure reproducible
results with fair comparisons, but we must also consider what
are the best ways to demonstrate that RL continues to matter.
